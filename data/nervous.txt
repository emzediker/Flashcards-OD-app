Systemic Anatomy, Physiology, & Disease — The Nervous System

The nervous system coordinates body activities and allows rapid responses to stimuli.
1 of 396
It controls communication between body parts and integrates sensory input with motor output.

The nervous system has two main anatomical divisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
2 of 396
The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord; the PNS includes cranial and spinal nerves linking the body to the CNS.

The main function of the CNS is processing information, integration, and issuing commands.
3 of 396
The PNS functions in communication between the CNS and the rest of the body.

The nervous system is divided functionally into the somatic and autonomic systems.
4 of 396
The somatic system controls voluntary skeletal muscle movement; the autonomic system regulates involuntary actions such as heart rate and digestion.

The autonomic system has sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.
5 of 396
The sympathetic system prepares the body for “fight or flight”; the parasympathetic system promotes “rest and digest.”

Neurons are the functional units of the nervous system.
6 of 396
Each neuron includes a cell body, dendrites, and an axon that transmits impulses.

Dendrites receive input; axons carry impulses away from the cell body.
7 of 396
Axons may be myelinated or unmyelinated—myelin increases conduction speed.

The myelin sheath in the PNS is produced by Schwann cells; in the CNS by oligodendrocytes.
8 of 396
Gaps between myelin segments are called nodes of Ranvier; they enable saltatory conduction.

Neuroglia support and protect neurons.
9 of 396
Astrocytes maintain the blood-brain barrier; microglia act as phagocytes.

Ependymal cells line the ventricles and produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
10 of 396
CSF cushions and nourishes the brain and spinal cord.

The resting membrane potential of a neuron is approximately –70 mV.
11 of 396
It is maintained by the sodium–potassium pump and membrane permeability.

When threshold is reached, depolarization occurs as Na⁺ enters the neuron.
12 of 396
Repolarization follows when K⁺ exits, restoring resting potential.

Action potentials travel along axons to synaptic terminals.
13 of 396
At synapses, neurotransmitters are released to transmit the signal to the next cell.

Common neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.
14 of 396
Acetylcholine stimulates skeletal muscle; dopamine is involved in reward and movement.

Serotonin affects mood and sleep; GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter.
15 of 396
Neurotransmitters bind to postsynaptic receptors to open ion channels or trigger second messengers.

The spinal cord extends from the medulla to about L1–L2.
16 of 396
It is protected by vertebrae, meninges, and CSF.

The meninges include dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater.
17 of 396
The subarachnoid space between arachnoid and pia contains CSF.

Gray matter is central and shaped like an “H”; white matter surrounds it.
18 of 396
Ascending tracts carry sensory information; descending tracts carry motor commands.

A reflex arc is the simplest functional unit of the nervous system.
19 of 396
It includes a receptor, sensory neuron, integration center, motor neuron, and effector.

The brain includes the cerebrum, cerebellum, diencephalon, and brainstem.
20 of 396
The cerebrum has two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum.

Each hemisphere has frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
21 of 396

The frontal lobe controls movement and speech; parietal interprets sensory input.
22 of 396
Temporal handles hearing and memory; occipital controls vision.

The cerebellum coordinates balance and smooth motion.
23 of 396

36 of 396
Schwann cells in the PNS guide axonal regrowth; oligodendrocytes in the CNS do not.

The blood–brain barrier protects the brain from toxins and pathogens.
37 of 396
It is formed by tight junctions in capillary endothelial cells and astrocyte processes.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates through ventricles and the subarachnoid space.
38 of 396
CSF provides cushioning, buoyancy, and nutrient transport for the CNS.

39 of 396
It flows from lateral ventricles → third ventricle → fourth ventricle → subarachnoid space → arachnoid villi → dural venous sinuses.

The brain requires a constant supply of oxygen and glucose.
40 of 396
