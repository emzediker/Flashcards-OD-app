Visual and Human Development
1 of 18
Definition: Overview of congenital, infectious, maternal, and developmental factors influencing visual system development from birth through early childhood.

Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
2 of 18
Ocular Associations: Keratoconus; pseudoesotropia due to epicanthal folds; refractive error common.

Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18)
3 of 18
Ocular Associations: Esotropia; cataract; optic nerve hypoplasia; juxtapapillary coloboma; retinal dysplasia.

Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY)
4 of 18
Ocular Associations: Microphthalmia; cataracts; pupil abnormalities.

Turner Syndrome (XO)
5 of 18
Ocular Associations: Strabismus; amblyopia; keratoconus.

Chickenpox (Varicella)
6 of 18
Ocular Manifestations: Chorioretinitis; cataracts; may contribute to sensory deficits.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
7 of 18
Ocular Manifestations: Chorioretinal lesions; commonly associated with HIV infection.

Rubella
8 of 18
Ocular Manifestations: TORCH infection; cataracts; retinopathy.

Toxoplasmosis
9 of 18
Ocular Manifestations: Cataracts; chorioretinal lesions; strabismus; optic atrophy.

Maternal Diabetes
10 of 18
Neonatal Effects: Increased birth weight; sectoral optic nerve hypoplasia; transient abnormal iris vasculature resolving within two weeks.

Preeclampsia
11 of 18
Neonatal Effects: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); optic nerve pallor; retinal vascular abnormalities.

Maternal Thyroid Disease
12 of 18
Neonatal Effects: Low birth weight; reduced cognitive function.

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
13 of 18
Key Fact: Leading cause of preventable mental retardation; associated with multiple ocular and neurologic abnormalities.

Folic Acid Deficiency
14 of 18
Neonatal Effects: Prematurity; neural tube defects.

Maternal Malnourishment
15 of 18
Neonatal Effects: Low birth weight; delayed development.

Maternal Tobacco Use
16 of 18
Neonatal Effects: Increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

APGAR Score
17 of 18
Definition: Newborn assessment of Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration; each scored 0–2. Timing: Assessed within 5 minutes of birth. Interpretation: Score ≥7 considered normal.

Coloboma
18 of 18
Associations: May be associated with CHARGE syndrome (Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia choanae, Retarded growth, Genital abnormalities, Ear anomalies).

Clinical Pearls – Visual & Human Development
19 of 18
Clinical Pearls:
• Keratoconus is associated with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome
• TORCH infections frequently cause cataracts and chorioretinal lesions
• Maternal diabetes may cause transient iris vasculature in neonates
• APGAR scores ≥7 indicate normal neonatal adaptation
• Visual acuity matures rapidly from approximately 20/400 in infancy to 20/20 by early childhood
