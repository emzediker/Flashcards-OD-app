Episcleritis
1 of 10
Definition: Inflammation of the episclera; typically affects young to middle-aged adults; may be recurrent.
Symptoms: Mild tenderness; red eye; minimal or no photophobia; no discharge.
Signs: Sectoral redness (one or both eyes); superficial vessels movable with cotton-tipped applicator; blanches with 2.5% phenylephrine.
Associations/Systemic: RA, SLE, rosacea, atopy, thyroid eye disease, gout, herpes zoster, syphilis, TB.
Treatment: Mild—artificial tears QID; moderate–severe—topical NSAID or mild topical steroid QID (oral NSAIDs may be preferred).
Follow-Up: Artificial tears only—recheck ~4 weeks; on steroids—every 1–2 weeks until resolved.

Scleritis
2 of 10
Definition: Deep, painful inflammation of the sclera; ~50% associated with systemic autoimmune disease.
Types:
• Non-necrotizing—Diffuse (~60%), Nodular (~25%)
• Necrotizing—with inflammation (most severe) or without inflammation (scleromalacia perforans; often painless)
Symptoms: Severe deep boring pain; photophobia; tearing; decreased vision.
Signs: Violaceous hue; scleral edema; does NOT blanch with phenylephrine.
Posterior Scleritis Clues: Choroidal folds, exudative RD, optic disc edema, macular edema, proptosis, rapid hyperopic shift; may mimic mass.
Treatment: Systemic NSAIDs → systemic steroids if needed; urgent immunosuppression/rheumatology for necrotizing disease.
Follow-Up: Close early follow-up (days) until improving.

Postoperative Endophthalmitis
3 of 10
Definition: Intraocular infection after surgery; most commonly coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (e.g., S. epidermidis).
Onset: Typically 3–7 days postop.
Symptoms: Decreased vision with significant pain.
Signs: Marked AC cell/flare, fibrin, hypopyon, vitreous haze, reduced red reflex.
Treatment: Ocular emergency—urgent intravitreal antibiotics ± vitrectomy (retina service).
Follow-Up: Hours–next day, then daily as directed.

Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)
4 of 10
Definition: Sterile toxic inflammatory reaction after anterior segment surgery.
Onset: 6–24 hours postop.
Symptoms: Blurred vision; mild–moderate discomfort.
Signs: Limbus-to-limbus corneal edema; intense AC inflammation; fibrin; minimal or no vitreous involvement.
Key Distinction: Lack of vitreous involvement distinguishes from endophthalmitis.
Treatment: Aggressive topical steroids; rule out infection.
Follow-Up: Daily until clear improvement.

Aniridia
5 of 10
Definition: Congenital partial or near-total absence of iris tissue.
Symptoms: Photophobia; reduced vision; glare.
Signs: Minimal or absent iris.
Associations/Systemic: WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, Aniridia, GU anomalies, intellectual disability).
Complications: Glaucoma, cataract, keratopathy.
Treatment: Prosthetic/colored contact lenses; glaucoma management; systemic screening when indicated.
Follow-Up: Every 3–6 months.

Iris Nevus
6 of 10
Definition: Benign iris stromal melanocytic lesion.
Symptoms: Asymptomatic.
Signs: Flat lesion <3 mm; possible mild pupil distortion.
Treatment: Documentation and observation.
Follow-Up: Annual monitoring.

Iris Melanoma
7 of 10
Definition: Malignant melanocytic tumor of the iris; better prognosis than posterior uveal melanoma.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic.
Signs: Enlarging iris mass (>3 mm diameter or >1 mm thickness), ectropion iridis, spontaneous hyphema, secondary glaucoma.
Treatment: Ocular oncology referral; observation vs excision/radiation depending on growth and complications.
Follow-Up: ~3 months if suspicious.

Anterior Uveitis
8 of 10
Definition: Inflammation of the iris and/or ciliary body.
Symptoms: Pain, redness, photophobia, decreased vision.
Signs: AC cell/flare; keratic precipitates; IOP low or elevated (herpetic, Fuchs).
KP Patterns:
• Fine—herpes, CMV, Fuchs
• Non-granulomatous—HLA-B27, JIA
• Granulomatous—sarcoid, TB, syphilis, VKH
Treatment: Topical corticosteroids + cycloplegic.
Follow-Up: Often within 24 hours initially.

Intermediate Uveitis
9 of 10
Definition: Inflammation primarily involving vitreous and pars plana.
Symptoms: Painless floaters; blurred vision.
Signs: Vitreous cells; snowballs; CME common.
Associations: MS, sarcoid, syphilis, Lyme, lymphoma, TINU.
Treatment: Observe if mild; periocular/systemic steroids if vision-threatening; treat CME.
Follow-Up: ~1 week if active; then every ~3 months.

Pars Planitis
10 of 10
Definition: Idiopathic autoimmune subtype of intermediate uveitis.
Symptoms: Painless floaters; decreased vision from CME.
Signs: Inferior pars plana snowbank exudates; vitreous snowballs.
Complications: CME most common cause of vision loss.
Treatment: Observation vs steroids depending on severity; manage CME.
Follow-Up: 1 week if active, then every 3 months.

Clinical Pearls – Episclera, Sclera & Anterior Uvea
11 of 10
• Episcleritis blanches with 2.5% phenylephrine; scleritis does NOT — this is a key bedside differentiator.
• Scleritis pain is deep, boring, and severe; think autoimmune disease (~50% association) and escalate beyond topical therapy early.
• Necrotizing scleritis and scleromalacia perforans are vision- and globe-threatening → urgent systemic immunosuppression and rheumatology involvement.
• Posterior scleritis can mimic a mass (choroidal folds, exudative RD, optic disc edema, rapid hyperopic shift); consider B-scan if suspected.
• TASS presents within 6–24 hours post-op, is sterile, and typically lacks vitreous involvement — contrast with infectious endophthalmitis.
• Post-op endophthalmitis usually presents days later (≈3–7 days) with pain, hypopyon, and vitreous haze → ocular emergency.
• Aniridia is strongly associated with WAGR syndrome — systemic screening (especially for Wilms tumor) is critical.
• Iris melanoma clues: growth, ectropion iridis, spontaneous hyphema, secondary glaucoma → ocular oncology referral.
• Anterior uveitis hypopyon is classically associated with Behçet disease (also seen in HLA-B27).
• Keratic precipitate patterns matter: fine (herpes/CMV/Fuchs), granulomatous (sarcoid, TB, syphilis, VKH).
• Pars planitis causes vision loss primarily via cystoid macular edema, not pain — treat CME aggressively when present.
• Intermediate uveitis = painless floaters + snowballs/snowbank, often in younger patients; always rule out MS and sarcoid.
