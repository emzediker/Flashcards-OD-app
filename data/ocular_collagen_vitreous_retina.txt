When in doubt, know plexiform means synapses.

Plexiform in the retina means:
35 of 65

Synaptic layer

The outer plexiform is made of:
36 of 65

Remember plexiform means synapse so you know it has to be two sets of cells communicating.

Outer plexiform is a synapse between photoreceptor and bipolar/ horizontal cells

The inner nuclear layer is made of:
37 of 65

Horizontal cells, Muller cells, bipolar cells, inner plexiform cells, and amacrine cells all have their nuclei in this layer.

The inner plexiform layer is made of:

The retinal nerve fiber layer is unmyelinated. When does it become myelinated?
47 of 65

After passing through lamina cribrosa?

Is there an inner limiting membrane at the optic nerve?
48 of 65

No. The ILM is absent at the optic nerve.

 What cells secrete the inner limiting membrane?

Muller cells

Muller cells are absent at the nerve so ILM is absent too.

61 of 65

choriocapillaris

True or false? The fovea has arteries and venules.
62 of 65

False. The fovea is avascular so it depends on getting fed solely by the fenestrated choroidal blood vessels.
