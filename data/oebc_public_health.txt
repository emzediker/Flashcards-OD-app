Biostatistics – Test Performance Metrics
1 of 8
Precision (Positive Predictive Value): True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).
Negative Predictive Value: True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives).
Sensitivity: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives).
Specificity: True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives).
Accuracy: (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total tested.
Reliability: Degree to which a test is repeatable and consistent.
Validity: Degree to which a test measures what it is intended to measure.
Clinical Pearl – High sensitivity rules OUT disease (SnNout); high specificity rules IN disease (SpPin).
Board Relevance: NBEO & OEBC – Explicit

ANSI Z80.1 – Power Tolerances
2 of 8
Sphere Power Tolerance: < ±6.50 D → ±0.13 D; ≥ ±6.50 D → ±2% of sphere power.
Cylinder Power Tolerance: <2.00 D → ±0.13 D; 2.00–4.50 D → ±0.15 D; >4.50 D → ±4% of cylinder power.
Cylinder Axis Tolerance: <0.25 D → ±14°; 0.25–0.50 D → ±7°; 0.75–1.00 D → ±5°; 1.25–1.50 D → ±3°; >1.50 D → ±2°.
Clinical Pearl – Axis tolerance tightens as cylinder power increases.
Board Relevance: NBEO – Explicit; OEBC – Conceptual

ANSI Z87.1 – Safety Glasses Standards
3 of 8
Drop Ball Test: 1-inch steel ball weighing 2.4 oz dropped from 50 inches.
Minimum Lens Thickness: 2.0 mm.
High Impact Marking (+): Indicates passing high velocity or high mass testing.
High Velocity Test: ¼-inch steel ball fired at 150 ft/sec.
High Mass Test: 500-gram pointed weight dropped from 50 inches.
Clinical Pearl – The “+” marking is required for occupational eye protection.
Board Relevance: NBEO – Explicit; OEBC – Conceptual

ANSI Z80.3 – Fashion Eyewear (Nonprescription)
4 of 8
Heat Resistance: Must not deform or ignite at 200°C for 15 minutes.
UV Protection Classes: Class I blocks ≥90% UV-A and ≥99% UV-B; Class II blocks ≥70% UV-A and ≥95% UV-B.
Clinical Pearl – Z80.3 applies to plano fashion eyewear, not prescription lenses.
Board Relevance: NBEO – Explicit; OEBC – Awareness Only

Environmental Vision – Photochromics & Lighting
5 of 8
Photochromic Lenses: Corning photochromatic lenses darken in UV exposure.
Glare Reduction: Block short-wavelength (blue) light; often yellow or amber tinted.
Color Rendering Index (CRI): Measures how naturally colors appear; scale 1–100, with 100 being ideal.
Clinical Pearl – Higher CRI improves visual comfort and color discrimination.
Board Relevance: NBEO & OEBC – Explicit

Environmental Protection Factor (EPF)
6 of 8
Definition: Measures effectiveness of eyewear in blocking UV radiation.
Scale: Perfect EPF score is 100.
Comparison: Similar concept to SPF for sunscreen but applied to eyewear.
Clinical Pearl – EPF accounts for lens material, coatings, and frame coverage.
Board Relevance: NBEO & OEBC – Explicit

UV Protection by Lens Material
7 of 8
Polycarbonate: Best inherent UV protection.
CR-39: Provides some UV protection.
Crown Glass: Worst UV protection.
Clinical Pearl – Polycarbonate blocks nearly all UV without added coatings.
Board Relevance: NBEO & OEBC – Explicit

Clinical Trials – Drug Approval Phases
8 of 8
Phase 1: Drug tested on healthy volunteers for safety.
Phase 2: Tests efficacy and dosing in small group of affected patients.
Phase 3: Large-scale testing for efficacy and adverse reactions.
Phase 4: Post-marketing surveillance evaluating long-term effects and safety.
Clinical Pearl – Phase 4 occurs after regulatory approval.
Board Relevance: NBEO & OEBC – Explicit
