Primary Open Angle Glaucoma
1 of 18
Definition: Most common form of glaucoma.
Symptoms: Asymptomatic until late.
Visual Field: First defect is inferior nasal paracentral defect; other defects include arcuate scotoma, nasal step, and cecocentral defects; VF defects respect the horizontal meridian.
Optic Nerve / RNFL: Notching, increased C/D ratio, ISNT rule violation, RNFL thinning, Drance hemorrhages.
Other Signs: IOP >21 mmHg, nasalization of vessels, bayonetting, saucering.
Treatment: IOP lowering with SLT or ALT, topical medications (prostaglandins and ABCs), MIGS; filtering bleb if advanced.
Follow Up: Every 3–6 months depending on stability.

Normal Tension Glaucoma
2 of 18
Definition: Glaucoma with IOP consistently <21 mmHg.
Key Sign: Drance hemorrhages are more common than in POAG and suggest progression.
Treatment Goal: Reduce IOP approximately 30% from baseline.
Follow Up: Every 3–6 months.

Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome
3 of 18
Definition: Most common cause of secondary open-angle glaucoma.
Epidemiology: ~60% develop pseudoexfoliative glaucoma; more common in northern latitudes and Scandinavian descent.
Symptoms: Asymptomatic.
Signs: Exfoliative material on anterior lens capsule (best seen after dilation), pupillary ruff atrophy, central transillumination defects, weak zonules.
Treatment: Topical hypotensives and SLT.
Follow Up: Every 3 months due to rapid progression risk.

Pigment Dispersion Syndrome / Pigmentary Glaucoma
4 of 18
Definition: Pigment release from posterior iris causing trabecular blockage.
Risk Factors: Young myopic males with posteriorly bowed iris.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic; transient blurry vision after exercise.
Signs: Krukenberg spindle, mid-peripheral transillumination defects, heavily pigmented trabecular meshwork, Sampolesi line, fluctuating IOP.
Treatment: Treat glaucoma; SLT often very effective; consider LPI to flatten iris.
Follow Up: Annually if no glaucoma; every 3–6 months if glaucoma present.

Steroid-Induced Glaucoma
5 of 18
Definition: POAG-like glaucoma caused by steroid response.
Onset: In-eye (hours–days), on-eye (weeks), periocular (months), systemic (months).
Treatment: Taper or discontinue steroid if possible; add hypotensive therapy.
Follow Up: Weekly IOP monitoring.

Uveitis–Glaucoma–Hyphema Syndrome
6 of 18
Cause: Mechanical irritation from malpositioned PCIOL.
Symptoms: Pain, photophobia, decreased vision.
Signs: Triad of uveitis, elevated IOP, and hyphema.
Treatment: Atropine, topical steroids, topical beta blocker, systemic CAI; surgical IOL repositioning.
Follow Up: Daily until stable.

Infantile Glaucoma
7 of 18
Epidemiology: Bilateral in ~70%.
Symptoms: Photophobia, tearing, irritability.
Signs: Buphthalmos, Haab striae, corneal edema.
Treatment: Surgical IOP reduction.
Prognosis: C/D ratio may normalize if treated early.
Follow Up: Per surgeon, typically ~1 month initially.

Inflammatory Glaucoma
8 of 18
Mechanism: Acute trabeculitis or chronic inflammatory damage to trabecular meshwork.
Symptoms: Uveitis symptoms.
Signs: Anterior chamber inflammation with elevated IOP.
Treatment: Topical steroids, cycloplegics, and IOP-lowering agents.
Follow Up: 1–7 days.

Lens-Induced Glaucoma
9 of 18
Cause: Hypermature cataract causing secondary angle closure or inflammation.
Symptoms: Similar to acute angle closure.
Treatment: Control inflammation and IOP, then cataract extraction.
Follow Up: Urgent referral.

Angle Recession Glaucoma
10 of 18
Cause: Blunt ocular trauma.
Timing: Develops months to years after injury.
Symptoms: Asymptomatic.
Signs: Widened ciliary body band on gonioscopy, elevated IOP.
Treatment: Topical hypotensives; SLT/ALT ineffective.
Follow Up: Annually if stable; every 3–6 months if glaucoma present.

Posner–Schlossman Syndrome
11 of 18
Mechanism: Recurrent trabeculitis.
Symptoms: Pain, blurry vision, halos, headache, nausea.
Signs: Mild anterior uveitis with very high IOP and open angles.
Treatment: Topical steroids and hypotensives; paracentesis if severe.
Follow Up: Daily during acute episode.

Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (Acute)
12 of 18
Cause: Pupillary block leading to sudden angle closure.
Symptoms: Severe eye pain, halos, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting.
Signs: Very high IOP, corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber.
Treatment: Immediate ophthalmology referral; ABCs and oral acetazolamide; LPI definitive.
Follow Up: Next day, then manage narrow angles.

Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (Chronic)
13 of 18
Mechanism: Repeated subclinical angle-closure episodes.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic initially.
Signs: Broad PAS, narrow angles, glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
Treatment: LPI plus hypotensive therapy.
Follow Up: Weekly initially, then monthly.

Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome
14 of 18
Pathophysiology: Abnormal corneal endothelium migrates over angle causing secondary angle closure.
Epidemiology: More common in women.
Signs: Beaten bronze endothelium, iris distortion, corectopia.
Variants: Essential iris atrophy, Chandler syndrome, Cogan–Reese syndrome.
Treatment: IOP lowering (often surgical), hypertonic saline, possible corneal transplant.
Follow Up: 1 month if glaucoma; 6 months if stable.

Neovascular Glaucoma
15 of 18
Associations: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, CRVO (“90-day glaucoma”).
Symptoms: Pain, vision loss.
Signs: Rubeosis iridis, neovascularization of angle, high IOP.
Treatment: IOP control plus PRP; cryotherapy if poor view.
Follow Up: 1–2 days.

Plateau Iris Configuration
16 of 18
Definition: Anteriorly positioned ciliary body causing narrow angles.
Key Point: LPI does not relieve angle closure.
Treatment: Argon iridoplasty or gonioplasty.
Follow Up: Based on angle status.

Aqueous Misdirection (Malignant Glaucoma)
17 of 18
Presentation: High IOP with shallow or flat anterior chamber.
Treatment: Atropine and aggressive IOP lowering.

Blebitis
18 of 18
Definition: Infection or inflammation of a filtering bleb.
Symptoms: Painful red eye, blurry vision, photophobia.
Signs: White inflamed bleb, anterior chamber reaction, possible hypopyon or vitritis.
Treatment: Topical antibiotics q1h; add steroids the following day.
Follow Up: Daily.

Clinical Pearls
19 of 18
• Primary open-angle glaucoma is typically asymptomatic until late stages, and glaucomatous visual field defects respect the horizontal meridian
• Drance hemorrhages are a key indicator of active glaucoma progression and are especially associated with normal tension glaucoma, where intraocular pressure remains below 21 mmHg
• Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is the most common cause of secondary open-angle glaucoma and can progress rapidly, requiring closer follow-up
• Pigment dispersion syndrome classically affects young myopic males and may present with exercise-induced blurry vision; selective laser trabeculoplasty is often highly effective
• Steroid-induced glaucoma can occur via any route of administration and may develop rapidly with topical ocular use
• Angle recession glaucoma may present months to years after blunt ocular trauma and does not respond well to laser trabeculoplasty
• Neovascular glaucoma is most commonly associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion and requires treatment of both intraocular pressure and retinal ischemia
• Plateau iris configuration remains at risk for angle closure despite a patent iridotomy
• Infantile glaucoma presents with photophobia, tearing, and buphthalmos and is primarily managed surgically
• Blebitis presents as a painful red eye with a white inflamed filtering bleb and requires urgent antibiotic therapy
