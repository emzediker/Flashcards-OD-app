Clinical Process & Board Pearls

Red Eye Triage:
• Pain, photophobia, or reduced vision = cornea or uvea until proven otherwise.
• Itching is allergic until proven otherwise.
• Severe pain out of proportion to signs raises concern for acanthamoeba or neurotrophic disease.
• Unilateral chronic follicular conjunctivitis in a young adult → think chlamydia or molluscum.

Discharge Patterns:
• Watery discharge → viral or allergic.
• Thick purulent discharge → bacterial.
• Copious hyperacute purulence → gonococcal (emergent).
• Stringy mucus → allergic or chlamydial.

Papillae vs Follicles:
• Papillae = allergic or bacterial.
• Follicles = viral, chlamydial, molluscum, toxic.
• Inferior follicles with pannus → chlamydial.
• Superior follicles with scarring → trachoma.

Preauricular Lymph Node:
• Present → viral or chlamydial.
• Absent → allergic or routine bacterial.

When to Culture:
• Large, central, or vision-threatening corneal ulcers.
• Contact lens–related ulcers not improving.
• Post-surgical or immunocompromised patients.
• Any ulcer worsening on appropriate therapy.

Contact Lens Red Flags:
• Always suspect Pseudomonas in contact lens wearers.
• Pain > signs + slow progression → suspect acanthamoeba or fungal keratitis.
• Remove lenses immediately and discontinue wear.

Corneal vs Conjunctival Disease:
• Conjunctival disease rarely causes photophobia.
• Corneal involvement causes photophobia, pain, and decreased vision.
• SPK alone can still be very painful (UV keratitis, Thygeson).

Steroid Use Pearls:
• Never use steroids in undiagnosed red eye with epithelial defect.
• Adenoviral SEIs are treated with steroids only if central or visually significant.
• Peripheral sterile infiltrates may benefit from steroids after infection ruled out.

Symblepharon Associations:
• Cicatricial pemphigoid
• Stevens-Johnson syndrome / TEN
• Severe atopic disease

Pain Discrepancy:
• Severe pain with minimal findings → acanthamoeba.
• Minimal pain with severe findings → neurotrophic keratopathy.

Peripheral Corneal Disease:
• Sectoral thinning with autoimmune disease → PUK.
• Non-inflammatory superior thinning in men → Terrien marginal degeneration.
• Elevated adjacent lesion with thinning → dellen.

Post-Refractive Surgery:
• LASIK patients may develop dry eye or ectasia.
• RK patients often have diurnal fluctuations and unstable refraction.
• Scleral lenses are often helpful in post-RK irregular corneas.

Urgent / Emergent Referrals:
• Gonococcal conjunctivitis.
• Stevens-Johnson syndrome / TEN.
• Rapidly progressive corneal ulcers.
• Corneal graft rejection.
• Suspected acanthamoeba or fungal keratitis.

Board Exam Traps:
• Acanthamoeba is NOT bacterial despite appearing in “bacterial keratitis” lists.
• Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy and children < 8 years.
• Painful red eye with follicles ≠ allergic.
• Chronic unilateral conjunctivitis is never “just pink eye.”
