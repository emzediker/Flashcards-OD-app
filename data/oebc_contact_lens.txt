Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) Fitting Basics
1 of 9
Initial Base Curve Selection: Average K reading minus 0.75 D.
Optic Zone: Central optical portion of the RGP lens.
Overall Diameter: Total diameter of the lens.
Base Curve (BC): Curvature of the optic zone.
Secondary/Tertiary Curves: Peripheral curves forming the lens edge.
Clinical Pearl: Initial RGP fitting is based on corneal curvature, not refractive error.

RGP Fluorescein Patterns
2 of 9
Steep Fit: Excessive central fluorescein pooling.
Flat Fit: Central corneal touch with peripheral pooling.
Astigmatic Cornea: Fluorescein pools along the steep meridian.
Clinical Pearl: Excess central fluorescein indicates a steep lens; central touch indicates a flat lens.

RGP Lens Types
3 of 9
Front Surface Toric: Astigmatism on the front surface; rarely used in corneal RGPs, common in sclerals.
Back Surface Toric: Astigmatism on the posterior surface of the lens.
Bitoric Lens: Astigmatism present on both front and back surfaces.
Clinical Pearl: Bitoric lenses are indicated for high corneal astigmatism with residual astigmatism.

FDA Soft Contact Lens Groups
4 of 9
Group 1: Low water, non-ionic.
Group 2: High water, non-ionic.
Group 3: Low water, ionic.
Group 4: High water, ionic.
Group 5: Silicone hydrogels.
Clinical Pearl: Water content is the most important factor for deposit formation; Group 1 lenses deposit the least.

Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC)
5 of 9
Etiology: Contact lens overwear and allergic response to protein deposits.
Symptoms: Itching, irritation, excessive lens movement.
Signs: Ropy mucus and giant papillae on the superior tarsal conjunctiva.
Management: Change lens brand, reduce wear time, switch to daily disposables.
Severe Cases: Discontinue lens wear for 1–4 months; consider mast cell stabilizer.
Clinical Pearl: GPC is both mechanical and immunologic in origin.

Contact Lens–Induced Neovascularization
6 of 9
Etiology: Tight lens fit and chronic overwear causing corneal hypoxia.
Clinical Significance: Greater than 2 mm of neovascularization is significant.
Treatment: Discontinue lens wear; topical steroid to induce regression.
Severe Cases: Refer for argon laser therapy.
Refit Strategy: Higher Dk/t lens and patient education on proper wear time.
Clinical Pearl: Hypoxia is the primary driver of corneal neovascularization.

Tight Lens Syndrome
7 of 9
Signs: Conjunctival indentation, SPK, corneal edema, anterior chamber cells and flare.
Management: Discontinue contact lens wear.
Medical Treatment: Topical steroid for edema or inflammation; cycloplegic if AC reaction present.
Long-Term: Refit with a looser lens after resolution.
Clinical Pearl: Tight lenses reduce tear exchange and increase hypoxic stress.

Contact Lens Solution Hypersensitivity
8 of 9
Etiology: Toxic or allergic reaction to contact lens solution preservatives.
Management: Switch to a peroxide-based cleaning system.
Adjunctive Care: Prophylactic topical antibiotic if epithelial compromise is present.
Clinical Pearl: Always rule out solution toxicity before changing lens 

Corneal Findings from Contact Lens Wear
9 of 9
Jelly Bumps: Focal protein or debris trapped beneath the contact lens.
Mucin Balls: Goblet cell stimulation causes mucin spheres that dislodge after lens removal, leaving fluorescein pooling.
Microcysts: Caused by chronic corneal hypoxia; managed by reducing wear time or increasing Dk/t.
Dimple Veiling: Gas bubbles beneath a tight RGP lens.
Protein Deposits: Result of overwear; discard lens and reinforce hygiene.
Clinical Pearl: Most contact lens–related corneal findings are due to hypoxia or poor tear Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) Clinical Pearls


Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) Clinical Pearls
1 of 2
Clinical Pearls:
• Initial RGP base curve selection is based on corneal curvature (average K − 0.75 D), not refractive error.
• Excessive central fluorescein pooling indicates a steep RGP fit; central corneal touch indicates a flat fit.
• Fluorescein pooling along the steep meridian suggests corneal astigmatism.
• Tight RGP lenses reduce tear exchange and cause hypoxia.
• Dimple veiling results from gas bubbles trapped beneath a tight RGP lens.
• Corneal neovascularization >2 mm is clinically significant and is primarily due to hypoxia from tight fit or overwear.
• Microcysts indicate chronic hypoxia and improve with reduced wear time or higher Dk/t materials.


Soft Contact Lens Clinical Pearls
2 of 2
Clinical Pearls:
• Water content is the most important determinant of soft contact lens deposit formation.
• Group 1 (low water, non-ionic) lenses deposit the least.
• Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC) is commonly due to overwear and protein deposition.
• Symptoms of GPC include itching and excessive lens movement.
• Contact lens solution hypersensitivity should be suspected before changing lens material.
• Peroxide-based systems reduce preservative toxicity.
• Most soft lens complications are related to hypoxia or poor hygiene rather than material failure.
