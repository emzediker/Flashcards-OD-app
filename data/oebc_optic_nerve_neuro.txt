Optic Nerve + Neuro-Ophthalmic Pathways

Optic Neuritis
1 of 12
Definition: Inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve most commonly associated with multiple sclerosis.
Key Findings: Pain with eye movement, decreased visual acuity, RAPD, dyschromatopsia.
Visual Field: Central scotoma most common.
Fundus: Often normal (retrobulbar neuritis); may show optic disc edema.
Imaging: MRI brain and orbits with contrast showing optic nerve enhancement.
Management: IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day x 3 days may speed recovery.

Ischemic Optic Neuropathy – Non-Arteritic (NAION)
2 of 12
Definition: Acute ischemia of the optic nerve head unrelated to inflammation.
Risk Factors: Hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea, small cup-to-disc ratio.
Key Findings: Sudden painless vision loss, altitudinal field defect.
Fundus: Hyperemic disc edema with splinter hemorrhages.
Management: Control systemic risk factors; no proven acute treatment.

Ischemic Optic Neuropathy – Arteritic (AAION)
3 of 12
Definition: Optic nerve infarction due to giant cell arteritis.
Key Findings: Sudden profound vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication.
Labs: Elevated ESR, CRP, platelets.
Management: Immediate high-dose IV steroids to prevent fellow-eye involvement.

Papilledema
4 of 12
Definition: Bilateral optic disc edema due to increased intracranial pressure.
Key Findings: Transient visual obscurations, headache, pulsatile tinnitus.
Visual Acuity: Often normal early.
Imaging: Neuroimaging required before lumbar puncture.
Management: Treat underlying cause; weight loss and acetazolamide in IIH.

Optic Disc Drusen
5 of 12
Definition: Calcified deposits within the optic nerve head.
Key Findings: Elevated disc with irregular margins, no hyperemia.
Imaging: B-scan ultrasound or OCT shows hyperreflective deposits.
Visual Field: Arcuate or nasal defects common.
Management: Observation; monitor visual fields.

Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy
6 of 12
Definition: Mitochondrial inherited optic neuropathy.
Key Findings: Young males, painless bilateral central vision loss.
Fundus: Hyperemic disc with peripapillary telangiectasia.
Management: Genetic counseling; idebenone may be beneficial.

Compressive Optic Neuropathy
7 of 12
Definition: Optic nerve dysfunction from external compression.
Key Findings: Progressive vision loss, optic atrophy.
Causes: Tumors, aneurysms, thyroid eye disease.
Imaging: MRI of brain and orbits.
Management: Treat underlying compressive lesion.

Traumatic Optic Neuropathy
8 of 12
Definition: Optic nerve injury secondary to head or orbital trauma.
Key Findings: Sudden vision loss following trauma.
Imaging: CT to assess fractures.
Management: Observation; role of steroids controversial.

Toxic/Nutritional Optic Neuropathy
9 of 12
Definition: Optic nerve damage from toxins or nutritional deficiency.
Causes: Methanol, ethambutol, B12 deficiency.
Key Findings: Bilateral symmetric vision loss, central scotomas.
Management: Remove toxin, correct deficiency.

Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy
10 of 12
Definition: Progressive optic nerve damage associated with glaucoma.
Key Findings: Increased cupping, RNFL loss.
Visual Field: Arcuate defects, nasal step.
Management: Lower intraocular pressure.

Chiasmal Lesions
11 of 12
Definition: Lesions affecting the optic chiasm.
Key Findings: Bitemporal hemianopsia.
Common Causes: Pituitary adenoma.
Imaging: MRI of the sella.
Management: Neurosurgical referral.

Post-Chiasmal Lesions
12 of 12
Definition: Lesions posterior to the optic chiasm.
Key Findings: Homonymous hemianopsia.
Localization: Optic tract, radiation, occipital cortex.
Management: Treat underlying cause.

Clinical Pearl – Optic Neuritis
13 of 12
Pearl: Visual recovery is common, but recurrence risk increases with MS.

Clinical Pearl – Papilledema
14 of 12
Pearl: Visual acuity may remain normal until late stages despite marked disc edema.
