How are fibrils arranged in the cornea to allow for a clear appearance.
9 of 70

How does the cornea appear when it is collecting fluid and  edema to separates collagen fibrils non-uniformly?
10 of 70

The cornea becomes less clear and the 
patient has cloudy vision.

The cornea is avascular. How does it get nutrients?
11 of 70

DIFFUSION from tears and aqueous. 

(There is a low diffusion amount at peripheral cornea by the limbus)

True or false? The cornea has NO MITOCHONDRIA.
12 of 70

False. There are mitochondria but they have to be spaced uniformly and spread out 
to maintain clarity.

Epithelium vs endothelium of cornea: 

Which has more concentration of mitochondria?
13 of 70

Endothelium has much more mitochondria by far! It needs a lot of energy to constantly pump fluid!

Aqueous vs tear layer:  Which houses more glucose, and which houses more oxygen?
14 of 70

1. tear layer= more oxygen2. aqueous= more glucose

Glucose transporters on the corneal epithelium are on which side of the cell? Apical or Basal?
15 of 70

There are no glucose transporters on the apical side (meaning out towards the tears). 

The glucose transporters of the epithelium are ONLY ON BASAL SIDE (more posterior). SO GLUCOSE TO THE EPITHELIUM IS ONLY FROM THE AQUEOUS.

In diabetes, sorbitol can be elevated in the cornea.

16 of 70

poor wound healing

22 of 70

lactic acid

Name a common buffer in the cornea that decreases levels of lactic acid.
23 of 70

What is the pH of the open eye’s tear layer and aqueous?
27 of 70

Tear layer 7.8 vs Aqueous 7.4 

Tear layer a tad more basic due to pCO2 being low.

What is a closed eye’s pH of the tear layer and aqueous?
28 of 70

Tear layer is 6.97 (more acidic than aqueous) vs aqueous is 7.10 

(think: CO2 HIGHER THAN IN THE OPEN EYE so it is MORE acidic)

Why does the corneal swelling pressure increase with stromal hydration?
29 of 70

Negative forces on (glycosaminoglycans) GAGs suck fluid into stroma.

The corneal stroma is happy when it is filled with the perfect amount of H2O. 

What is the term used to "dehydrate" the cornea by having the endothelial pumps pull out the excess fluid to allow for clarity?
30 of 70

deturgescence

Why does the corneal swell 4% after sleeping?
31 of 70


Edema occurs due to corneal hypoxia AND the tears are salty (hypertonic 305 mOsm) and pulls out water through the epithelium. 

There are no salty tears while closed so 4% remains in the cornea.

The corneal epithelium has a voltage of 15-20 due to:
32 of 70

Cl- efflux out of the epithelium

The X, Y, Z theory states epithelial corneal cells increase at night due to:
33 of 70

Higher levels of CO2 when the eyes are close results in higher acidity. This pH change desquamates (kills) weaker cells so newer cells migrate from bottom to replenish them.

ADHESIVE strength within the cornea IS HIGHER at:?? ANTERIOR or POSTERIOR ?? 

stroma.

41 of 70

The anterior stroma has higher adhesive strength. Lamellae closer together so harder to separate.

vitamin C and vitamin E help to form what antioxidants in the crystalline lens?
58 of 70

glutathione

Glutathione decreases naturally in an aging lens. Why is this important?

less antioxidants leads to more free radicals which leads to more cataract formation.

What does the term "high extravascular pressure" mean in reference to the eye.
69 of 70

The eye has a high pressure in eye compared to its surface area.

 This DOES NOT have to do with vasculature. 

Most intravascular pressure is from veins and arteries.

True or False? The retina has only one blood supply.
70 of 70

False. The retina has a dual blood supply. The inner layers are nourished by the central retinal artery and the outer retinal layers are supported by the choroidal circulation.
