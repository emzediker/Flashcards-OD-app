Cataracts – Overview
1 of 16
Definition: Opacity of the crystalline lens causing light scatter and reduced visual function.
Types: Congenital or acquired (age-related and non–age-related).
Core Symptoms: Blurred vision, glare, halos, night driving difficulty, reduced contrast.
Core Sign: Lens opacification on slit lamp examination.

Congenital Cataracts
2 of 16
Definition: Lens opacities present at birth; severity ranges from minimal to severe visual deprivation.
Signs: Leukocoria, strabismus, nystagmus; variable morphology.
Common Types: Lamellar/zonular (most common), nuclear, polar, sutural.
Key Associations: Galactosemia (oil droplet), hypoglycemia (zonular), hypocalcemia (punctate), rubella (pearly white), Fabry, Lowe, Alport syndromes.
Management: Urgent cataract surgery if visually significant; amblyopia prevention critical.

Age-Related Cataracts
3 of 16
Etiology: Oxidative stress and cumulative UV exposure.
Major Types: Nuclear sclerosis, cortical cataract, posterior subcapsular cataract.
Symptoms: Gradual vision decline, glare, halos, night vision difficulty.
Management: Surgical extraction when visually significant.

Nuclear Sclerosis Cataract
4 of 16
Appearance: Yellowing or brunescence of the nucleus.
Refractive Effect: Progressive myopic shift.

Cortical Cataract
5 of 16
Appearance: Vacuoles progressing to spoke-like cortical opacities.
Symptoms: Prominent glare, worse at night.
Refractive Effect: May induce hyperopic shift.

Posterior Subcapsular Cataract
6 of 16
Location: Posterior pole of the lens.
Symptoms: Disproportionately affects near vision; rapid visual decline.
Associations: Steroids, uveitis, diabetes, trauma, radiation, atopic disease.

Mature and Hypermature Cataracts
7 of 16
Mature: Completely opacified white cortex.
Hypermature: Liquefied cortex with floating nucleus.
Complications: Phacolytic and phacomorphic glaucoma.

Non–Age-Related Acquired Cataracts
8 of 16
Causes: Systemic disease, medications, inflammation, radiation, trauma.
Drug Associations: Miotics, thioridazine, amiodarone, chlorpromazine.

Christmas Tree Cataract
9 of 16
Appearance: Multicolored refractile crystalline deposits.
Systemic Association: Myotonic dystrophy.

Snowflake Cataract
10 of 16
Appearance: Snowflake-like opacities.
Systemic Association: Diabetes mellitus; rapid onset possible.

Rosette Cataract
11 of 16
Appearance: Rosette-shaped lens opacity.
Cause: Blunt ocular trauma.
Clinical Pearl: Consider non-accidental trauma in children without clear injury history.

Sunflower Cataract
12 of 16
Appearance: Sunflower pattern lens opacity.
Systemic Association: Wilson disease; often with Kayser–Fleischer rings.

Posterior Capsule Opacification
13 of 16
Definition: Secondary cataract from lens epithelial cell proliferation after PCIOL.
Symptoms: Blur, glare, halos, decreased night vision.
Treatment: YAG laser capsulotomy.
Complications: IOP spike, CME, retinal detachment.

Bullous Keratopathy (Aphakic/Pseudophakic)
14 of 16
Cause: Corneal endothelial failure after cataract surgery.
Symptoms: Pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation.
Treatment: Hypertonic saline, IOP control; severe cases require keratoplasty.

Ectopia Lentis
15 of 16
Definition: Partial or complete displacement of the crystalline lens.
Most Common Cause: Blunt trauma.
Systemic Associations: Marfan syndrome (superotemporal displacement); homocystinuria (inferonasal displacement).
Symptoms: Blur, monocular diplopia, angle-closure symptoms.
Management: Surgical lens removal when visually significant.

Clinical Pearls – Crystalline Lens & Cataracts
28 of 27
Congenital: Leukocoria in an infant is an ocular emergency requiring urgent evaluation; lamellar cataracts are the most common congenital cataract.
Vision Impact: Posterior subcapsular cataracts disproportionately affect near vision.
Advanced Cataracts: Hypermature cataracts can cause secondary glaucomas (phacolytic, phacomorphic).
Systemic Associations: Christmas tree cataracts suggest myotonic dystrophy; snowflake cataracts may develop rapidly in diabetes.
Trauma: Rosette cataracts in children without a clear injury history raise concern for non-accidental trauma.
Post-Surgical: Posterior capsule opacification is common after cataract surgery and is treated with YAG capsulotomy; bullous keratopathy can be painful and vision-threatening.
Lens Dislocation: Marfan syndrome classically causes superotemporal crystalline lens dislocation.
