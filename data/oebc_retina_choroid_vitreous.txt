Serpiginous Choroidopathy
1 of 20
Definition: Idiopathic, chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease of the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium characterized by progressive geographic lesions.

Epidemiology: Typically affects middle-aged adults, more commonly males (50–60 years). Associated with HLA-B7. Tuberculosis must be ruled out due to similar presentation.

Pathophysiology: Inflammatory choroiditis beginning near the optic nerve head with centrifugal spread toward the macula, resulting in chorioretinal atrophy and scarring.

Symptoms: Blurred or decreased central vision, scotomas. May be unilateral or bilateral.

Clinical Signs: Gray-white geographic lesions with active borders radiating from the optic disc. Older lesions show atrophy and pigmentary changes. CNVM occurs in approximately 25% of cases.

Treatment: Systemic or local corticosteroids initially. Immunomodulatory therapy for recurrent disease. CNVM treated with anti-VEGF therapy.

Follow-up: Based on disease activity and severity.

Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)
2 of 20
Definition: Retinal venous occlusive disease caused by thrombosis of the central retinal vein, leading to impaired venous drainage and retinal ischemia.

Types: Non-ischemic (perfused) and ischemic (non-perfused).

Risk Factors: Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, glaucoma, hypercoagulable states, advanced age.

Pathophysiology: Compression of the central retinal vein at the lamina cribrosa causes venous stasis, hemorrhage, macular edema, and capillary nonperfusion.

Symptoms: Sudden, painless unilateral vision loss of variable severity.

Clinical Signs: Diffuse retinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (“blood and thunder”), dilated tortuous veins, cotton wool spots, optic disc edema, macular edema.

Complications: Neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment.

Management: Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular edema. Steroids may be used. Panretinal photocoagulation for neovascularization.

Follow-up: Frequent monitoring, especially in ischemic CRVO.

Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)
3 of 20
Definition: Acute retinal arterial obstruction causing severe retinal ischemia and profound vision loss.

Etiology: Embolic or thrombotic occlusion, commonly from carotid or cardiac sources. Giant cell arteritis must be ruled out in older patients.

Risk Factors: Carotid artery disease, cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus.

Pathophysiology: Sudden interruption of retinal arterial blood flow leading to inner retinal infarction.

Symptoms: Sudden, painless, profound unilateral vision loss.

Clinical Signs: Pale edematous retina, cherry-red spot at the fovea, attenuated retinal arteries, possible visible embolus.

Management: Ocular emergency. Immediate systemic vascular evaluation. Ocular massage and IOP-lowering measures may be attempted but prognosis is poor.

Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)
4 of 20
Definition: Occlusion of a branch retinal vein, typically at an arteriovenous crossing.

Risk Factors: Hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus.

Symptoms: Sudden painless vision loss or visual field defect.

Clinical Signs: Sectoral retinal hemorrhages, dilated veins, cotton wool spots, macular edema.

Complications: Macular edema, retinal neovascularization.

Management: Anti-VEGF therapy for macular edema. Laser photocoagulation for neovascularization.

Follow-up: Based on ischemic status and macular involvement.

Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO)
5 of 20
Definition: Occlusion of a branch retinal artery resulting in sectoral retinal ischemia.
