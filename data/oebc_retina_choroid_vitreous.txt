Additional risk factors include poor glycemic control and large fluctuations in plasma glucose.

Severity Scale:
Mild NPDR:
Microaneurysms only.

Moderate NPDR:
More than mild NPDR but less than severe NPDR.

Severe NPDR (4-2-1 Rule):
Four quadrants of dot-blot hemorrhages greater than standard photo 2A (more than 20 hemorrhages).
Two or more quadrants of venous beading.
One or more quadrants of intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA).

Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR):
Presence of retinal neovascularization.

High-Risk PDR:
Neovascularization of the disc greater than one-quarter disc diameter.
Neovascularization of the disc with vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage.
Neovascularization elsewhere with vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage.

Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME):
Retinal thickening within 500 microns of the foveal center.
Hard exudates within 500 microns of the fovea with associated retinal thickening.
Retinal thickening one disc diameter or larger within one disc diameter of the foveal center.

Symptoms:
Often asymptomatic.
May report blurred or fluctuating vision.

Clinical Signs:

Gestational Diabetes – Ocular Considerations
2 of 51
