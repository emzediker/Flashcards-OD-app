Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic Retinopathy
1 of 52
Definition: Leading cause of blindness in the United States among adults aged 20–64.
Risk Factors: Primary risk factor is duration of diabetes; additional risk factors include poor glycemic control and large fluctuations in plasma glucose.
Severity Scale:
Mild NPDR: Microaneurysms only.
Moderate NPDR: More than mild NPDR but less than severe NPDR.
Severe NPDR (4-2-1 Rule): 4 quadrants of dot-blot hemorrhages (> standard photo 2A / >20); 2+ quadrants of venous beading; 1+ quadrant of IRMA.
PDR: Presence of retinal neovascularization.
High-Risk PDR: NVD > 1/4 DD; NVD with vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage; NVE with vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage.
CSME: Retinal thickening within 500 µm of foveal center; hard exudates within 500 µm with thickening; thickening ≥1 DD within 1 DD of foveal center.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic; may report blurred or fluctuating vision.
Clinical Signs: Findings as described in severity scale and macular edema criteria.
Treatment: Stage-dependent. Center-involving ME → intravitreal anti-VEGF (consider steroids if inadequate response). High-risk PDR → PRP. PDR (not high-risk) ± ME → anti-VEGF. PPV indications: dense non-clearing VH, TRD, ERM/VMT with significant symptoms, dense premacular hemorrhage, chronic DME unresponsive to therapy, or severe neovascular/fibrous proliferation unresponsive to PRP/anti-VEGF.
Follow-up: No retinopathy—annually; Mild NPDR—q6 months; Moderate/Severe NPDR—q4 months; PDR (not high-risk)—q2 months; High-risk PDR—monthly; Any CSME—monthly.

Gestational Diabetes – Ocular Considerations
2 of 52
Definition: Diabetic retinal changes occurring during pregnancy in patients with gestational diabetes or pre-existing diabetes affected by pregnancy-related metabolic changes.
Clinical Features: Similar to diabetic retinopathy (MAs, hemorrhages, macular edema; may progress to proliferative disease).
Risk Considerations: Rapid metabolic changes during pregnancy may accelerate DR progression, especially with poor glycemic control or pre-existing retinopathy.
Treatment: Same principles as DR; coordinate tight glycemic control with obstetric care. Anti-VEGF generally avoided in pregnancy unless vision-threatening; laser may be considered when indicated.
Follow-up: No retinopathy—1st and 3rd trimesters; Mild/Moderate NPDR—each trimester; Severe NPDR—monthly; PDR—monthly.

Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic; may have blurred vision if severe/malignant HTN.
Clinical Signs (Keith–Wagener–Barker): Group 1—arteriolar narrowing; Group 2—AV nicking; Group 3—flame hemorrhages, CWS, hard exudates; Group 4—optic disc swelling.

Ischemic vs Non-ischemic: >5 DD capillary nonperfusion on FA = ischemic BRVO.
Complications: Macular edema, neovascularization, (less commonly) vitreous hemorrhage.

Clinical Pearl – Macular Edema Treatment Rule
53 of 52
Rule:
Visually significant macular edema is treated first-line with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.

Applies To:
• Diabetic macular edema (DME)
• BRVO- and CRVO-related macular edema
• Wet AMD
• Radiation retinopathy
• MacTel with CNVM

Exceptions:
• Irvine–Gass syndrome → topical NSAID + steroid first
• Inflammatory CME → steroids earlier
• Chronic refractory CME → may require intravitreal or sub-Tenon steroid therapy


Clinical Pearl – Neovascularization Equals Ischemia
54 of 52
Rule:
Any retinal or iris neovascularization represents ischemia until proven otherwise.

Management Principle:
• Anti-VEGF for rapid regression
• Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for long-term ischemic control

Common Associations:
• Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
• Ischemic BRVO / CRVO
• Ocular ischemic syndrome
• Sickle cell retinopathy
• Radiation retinopathy
• Retinopathy of prematurity


Clinical Pearl – Retinal Artery vs Retinal Vein Occlusion
55 of 52
Key Distinction:
Retinal artery occlusions are neurologic emergencies.
Retinal vein occlusions are chronic ischemic retinal diseases.

Artery Occlusions (CRAO / BRAO):
• Require immediate stroke workup
• Rule out giant cell arteritis in patients >50 years old

Vein Occlusions (BRVO / CRVO):
• Cause macular edema and neovascularization
• Treated with anti-VEGF ± PRP
• CRVO requires monthly gonioscopy for 90 days (NVG risk)


Clinical Pearl – Steroids and Infection Rule
56 of 52
Rule:
Never initiate steroids until infection has been ruled out.

Treat Infection First In:
• Acute retinal necrosis → antivirals
• Toxoplasmosis → antimicrobials
• Candidiasis → antifungals

Important Note:
Steroids are adjunctive therapy, not first-line, in infectious retinal disease.


Clinical Pearl – Surgical Retina Indications
57 of 52
Vitrectomy Is Indicated For:
• Dense or non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage
• Tractional retinal detachment
• Symptomatic epiretinal membrane
• Macular holes (stages 3–4)
• Chronic diabetic macular edema unresponsive to medical therapy


Clinical Pearl – Inherited vs Acquired Retinal Disease
58 of 52
Inherited Retinal Diseases:
• Typically bilateral and symmetric
• Slowly progressive
• Examples: RP, Stargardt, Best, choroideremia

Acquired Retinal Diseases:
• Often asymmetric
• Associated with hemorrhage, edema, or ischemia
• Examples: diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusions, ocular ischemic syndrome


Clinical Pearl – High-Yield Retina Associations
59 of 52
Classic Board Associations:
• Cherry-red spot → CRAO
• Blood-and-thunder fundus → CRVO
• Sea-fan neovascularization → Sickle cell retinopathy
• Headlights in the fog → Toxoplasmosis
• Silent choroid on IVFA → Stargardt disease
• Egg-yolk lesion → Best disease
• ILM drape on OCT → MacTel type 2
• Cotton balls / string of pearls → Candidiasis
