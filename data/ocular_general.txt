Name the three coats of the eye:
1 of 28

1 Outer (cornea, sclera) 2 Middle (iris, ciliary body, choroid) 3 Inner (retina continuous with optic nerve)

Horizontal vs vertical diameter of eye:
2 of 28

horizontal 24.1mm (bigger horizontal) vs vertical 23.5mm

The middle coat of eye is also known as:
3 of 28

uvea

What does UVEA mean?
4 of 28

Grape in Latin - round and purple/red because it houses blood flow.

Mnemonic for uvea
5 of 28

UVEA - U look through me=iris_____Violet color= choroid_____Even blood flow_____Aqueous and Accommodation = ciliary body

The inner coat of eye (retina) is split into what two layers?
6 of 28

Neurosensory retina & retinal pigment epithelium

10 layers of the neurosensory retina
7 of 28

Inner to outer - * Inner limiting membrane* Nerve fiber layer* Ganglion cell layer* Inner plexiform layer* Inner nuclear layer* Outer plexiform layer* Outer nuclear layer* External limiting membrane* Photoreceptor inner segments* Photoreceptor outer segments

Mnemonic for the 10 layers of neurosensory retina:
8 of 28

Outer to Inner - 1. Pigmented2. Segment (outer, inner)3. Open naturally4. Open partially5. IN6. It’s Perineal7. Gorgeous8. Noteworthy9. Intro to light

Then corneal index of refraction is:
9 of 28

1.376

The average corneal thickness is:
10 of 28

~535 microns

Name all six extraocular muscles of the eye:
11 of 28

4 recti (superior, medial, inferior, lateral) & 2 obliques (superior and inferior)

Mnemonic for superior orbital fissure:
12 of 28

Really long fissures superiorly, tightly store nerves in a vesicle.

Name the contents of the superior orbital fissure:
13 of 28

Starting most superior - recurrent meningeal arterylacrimal nervefrontal nervesuperior ophthalmic veintrochlear nervesuperior oculomotor nervenasociliary nerveinferior oculomotor nerveabducens nerveinferior ophthalmic vein

Mnemonic for inferior orbital fissure:
14 of 28

"Zee Inferior Is Minimum

Contents of inferior orbital fissure:
15 of 28

Zygomatic nerve, Inferior and Infra (artery, vein, and nerve) & Maxillary nerve

Mnemonic for COMMON tendinous ring of Zinn
16 of 28

"Commonly stores nerves in an ocular O"

Contents of common tendinous ring of Zinn:
17 of 28

From most superior - Superior Oculomotor Nerve *Nasociliary Nerve *Inferior Oculomotor Nerve *Abducens Nerve Optic Nerve *Ophthalmic Artery

The ____ is the muscle of surprise.
18 of 28

Frontalis - Radially over eyebrows to forehead

The ____ is the muscle associated to voluntary closure of eyes (winks, forced squeezing) and pumping tears to the nasolacrimal system.
19 of 28

Orbicularis oculi

The ____ is the muscle associated with pulling eyebrows up and in during frowning.
20 of 28

Corrugator supercilious

The ____ is a muscle located on the bridge of the nose that contracts and makes furrow lines, as in when one smells something foul.
21 of 28

Procerus

Mnemonic for frontalis function:
22 of 28

Walk through the FRONT door for a SURPRISE party. - Frontalis is the muscle of surprise.

Mnemonic for orbicularis oculi function:
23 of 28

Think: Start superior temporal and you make an "O" with your finger tracing superior orbit inward to nose and down. This is pumping action and voluntary wink action.

Mnemonic for corrugator function:
24 of 28

C in “c”orrugator is for “c”oncerned frowning and frowning too long causes wrinkles in forehead.

Mnemonic for pyramid procerus function:
25 of 28

“P” in pyramid proceris for “Pee Yew” - It contacts the muscle at the bridge of the nose such as when someone senses a foul smell.

Three layers of tears and where each layer produced:
26 of 28

1. Mucin (inner) by goblet cells on conjunctiva 2. Aqueous (middle) by lacrimal gland/ Krause/ Wolfring 3. Meibum (outer) meibomian glands and Zeiss

Name the 5 layers of the cornea (Dua’s layer not included).
27 of 28

Starting superficial - *Epithelium *Bowman’s *Stroma *Descemet's *Endothelium

Name 10 layers of the retina (from inner to outer).
28 of 28

ILM *RNFL *GCC *IPL *INL *OPL *ONL *ELM *PIL *POL *RPE

The three components of the uvea are:
