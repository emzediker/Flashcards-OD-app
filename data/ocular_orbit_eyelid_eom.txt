CNIII palsy causes a lid droop. What muscle is implicated in this presentation?
25 of 90

The levator palpebrae superioris is blown. - Remember “LR6SO4 (all others 3)”: meaning the MR (medial rectus), and SR (superior rectus) are blown too. Hence why in a full CNIII palsy the eye is sitting down and out with ptosis.

Name the cell (not gland) that makes in the inner layer of mucin of tears, to get tears to adhere to the cornea.
33 of 90

Goblet cells

Where are goblet cells found?
34 of 90

In conjunctiva: high concentration at cornea limbal junction on the conjunctival side to produce mucin for cornea.

Goblet cells release wetting agents. Do they increase or decrease surface tension?
35 of 90

Think surface tension is like a gate to let other things in. If mucin and cornea have high surface tension they will not let others in their gate. Wetting agents decrease surface tension so the tears and cornea can bind.
