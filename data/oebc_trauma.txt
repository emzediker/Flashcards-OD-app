Sympathetic Ophthalmia
1 of 16
Definition: Autoimmune bilateral granulomatous uveitis after penetrating trauma or surgery to one eye.
Symptoms: Bilateral blur, pain, photophobia.
Signs: Bilateral granulomatous uveitis, vitritis, mid-peripheral multifocal infiltrates, serous retinal detachments.
Workup: Dilated exam; OCT for serous detachments; rule out other causes of panuveitis.
Treatment: Enucleation only prophylactic if injured eye is blind before inflammation; once active → aggressive systemic ± periocular ± topical steroids, cycloplegia, long-term immunosuppression often required.
Meds: Prednisone ~1 mg/kg PO (taper); Cyclopentolate 1% BID; Pred Forte or Durezol q1–2h then taper.
Follow-Up: 1–7 days.
Clinical Pearl: Prognosis can be good with early aggressive treatment (often >20/40).

Iridodialysis / Cyclodialysis
2 of 16
Definition: Iridodialysis = iris root disinsertion; Cyclodialysis = ciliary body separation from scleral spur.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic; monocular diplopia or glare if large.
Signs: Iris root tear; secondary glaucoma (angle damage) or hypotony from cyclodialysis cleft.
Treatment: Mild/cosmetic → sunglasses or opaque CL; glaucoma → IOP lowering; hypotony → atropine BID ± steroids.
Follow-Up: Long-term monitoring for angle recession glaucoma.
Clinical Pearl: Always monitor for delayed glaucoma after blunt trauma.


Corneal / Conjunctival Foreign Body
3 of 16
Definition: Superficial ocular foreign body; palpebral FB may cause linear abrasion.
Symptoms: Pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation.
Signs: Visible FB, abrasion, mild AC reaction.
Workup: Document VA first; slit lamp exam; rule out Seidel sign, hyphema, lens damage; consider IOFB based on mechanism.
Treatment: FB removal; rust ring removal if present; topical antibiotic (ointment preferred); CL wearers need Pseudomonas coverage.
Follow-Up: 24 hours.
Clinical Pearl: Always ask yourself—could this be an intraocular foreign body?


Conjunctival or Corneal Laceration
4 of 16
Definition: Partial-thickness laceration of conjunctiva or cornea.
Symptoms: Redness, photophobia, foreign body sensation.
Signs: Linear fluorescein staining; loose conjunctival tissue.
Workup: Rule out Seidel sign.
Treatment: Treat like corneal abrasion—erythromycin or polysporin ointment; cycloplegic if corneal involvement.
Follow-Up: 24 hours.
Clinical Pearl: Seidel positive = open globe emergency.


Chemical Burn (Ocular)
5 of 16
Definition: Acid or alkali injury to ocular surface; alkali burns are more severe.
Symptoms: Pain, photophobia, blurred vision.
Signs: Conjunctival injection or blanching; corneal haze; risk of symblepharon.
Treatment: Immediate copious irrigation until pH 7.0–7.4; sweep fornices; PF tears hourly; topical antibiotics; cycloplegia; short-term topical steroids (taper after 7–14 days).
Follow-Up: Daily initially.
Clinical Pearl: White/ischemic eye = severe injury.


Recurrent Corneal Erosion
6 of 16
Definition: Poor epithelial adhesion, often post-trauma or EBMD-related.
Symptoms: Recurrent sharp pain on awakening.
Signs: Inferior epithelial defects; EBMD changes.
Treatment: Antibiotic ointment; BCL if large; hypertonic saline HS; cycloplegia; amniotic membrane if refractory.
Follow-Up: 1–2 days until healed.
Clinical Pearl: Morning pain with repeat “abrasions” is classic.


Hyphema
7 of 16
Definition: Blood in anterior chamber; trauma most common cause.
Symptoms: Pain, blurred vision.
Signs: Layered blood or circulating RBCs.
Treatment: Bedrest, head elevation, rigid shield, cycloplegia; avoid NSAIDs; topical steroids if inflammation; screen for sickle cell disease.
Follow-Up: Daily monitoring for rebleed and IOP.
Clinical Pearl: Rebleed risk peaks days 3–5.


Choroidal Rupture
8 of 16
Definition: Tear of choroid, Bruch’s membrane, and RPE after blunt trauma.
Symptoms: Decreased vision or asymptomatic.
Signs: Yellow-white crescent-shaped streaks concentric to disc.
Treatment: Observe; treat CNVM if it develops.
Follow-Up: Monitor up to 6 months.
Clinical Pearl: CNVM risk increases if rupture is near the fovea.


Commotio Retinae (Berlin Edema)
9 of 16
Definition: Photoreceptor outer segment disruption after blunt trauma.
Symptoms: Decreased vision or asymptomatic.
Signs: Retinal whitening; cherry-red spot if posterior pole involved.
Treatment: Observation only.
Follow-Up: 1-week DFE.
Clinical Pearl: Usually resolves but severe cases may leave permanent vision loss.


Chorioretinitis Sclopetaria
10 of 16
Definition: High-velocity missile injury causing shock-wave retinal and choroidal damage without globe penetration.
Symptoms: Vision loss or asymptomatic.
Signs: Retinal/choroidal rupture with exposed sclera; fibrosis and scarring.
Treatment: Observation; PPV if persistent vitreous hemorrhage.
Follow-Up: ~2 weeks.
Clinical Pearl: Despite severity, retinal detachment is uncommon.


Purtscher’s Retinopath
11 of 16
Definition: Retinal microvascular injury after chest compression or trauma.
Symptoms: Sudden vision loss, often bilateral.
Signs: Cotton wool spots, retinal whitening, hemorrhages, disc edema.
Treatment: No proven therapy; partial recovery common.
Follow-Up: Every 2 weeks.
Clinical Pearl: Seen after CPR or severe chest trauma.


Traumatic Optic Neuropathy
12 of 16
Definition: Optic nerve injury from direct or indirect trauma.
Symptoms: Sudden vision loss.
Signs: RAPD, dyschromatopsia; optic pallor delayed weeks.
Treatment: Rule out life-threatening injuries; management individualized with trauma/neuro-ophth.
Follow-Up: Urgent specialty care.
Clinical Pearl: Immediate pallor suggests pre-existing optic neuropathy.


Shaken Baby Syndrome
13 of 16
Definition: Abusive head trauma with characteristic ocular findings.
Symptoms: Lethargy, seizures, irritability.
Signs: Extensive multilayered retinal hemorrhages.
Management: Mandatory reporting; urgent multidisciplinary evaluation.
Clinical Pearl: Retinal hemorrhage pattern is diagnostic.

Orbital Compartment Syndrome
14 of 16
Definition: Vision-threatening rise in orbital pressure, usually from retrobulbar hemorrhage.
Symptoms: Severe pain, decreased vision.
Signs: Proptosis, RAPD, elevated IOP, tight orbit, restricted EOMs.
Treatment: Immediate lateral canthotomy/cantholysis.
Clinical Pearl: Time = vision.


Blowout Fracture
15 of 16
Definition: Orbital floor fracture, commonly maxillary bone.
Symptoms: Diplopia, pain with eye movement, cheek/lip numbness.
Signs: Restricted upgaze, enophthalmos, V2 hypoesthesia.
Treatment: No nose blowing; CT orbit; surgical repair if indicated.
Clinical Pearl: Diplopia + V2 numbness = classic.


Cavernous Sinus Syndrome
16 of 16
Definition: Multiple cranial neuropathies from cavernous sinus pathology (e.g., CCF, mucormycosis, tumors).
Symptoms: Diplopia, ptosis, facial numbness.
Signs: CN III, IV, VI, V1/V2 involvement; ophthalmoplegia.
Treatment: Treat underlying cause; mucormycosis = emergency IV antifungals.
Clinical Pearl: Multiple CN palsies localize to cavernous sinus.

Trauma – Mega Clinical Pearls
17 of 16
Clinical Pearls:
• Always rule out open globe after ocular trauma—look for Seidel sign, asymmetric low IOP, peaked pupil, shallow AC, iris defects, or lens damage.
• Document visual acuity before any procedure (including FB removal); topical anesthetic does not invalidate VA documentation.
• High-velocity mechanisms = think IOFB, even with small external wounds.
• Alkali burns are more severe than acids—irrigate immediately and continuously until pH 7.0–7.4 and fornices are cleared.
• White or blanched conjunctiva indicates limbal ischemia and poor prognosis.
• Hyphema rebleed risk peaks days 3–5—avoid NSAIDs/ASA, elevate head, use a rigid shield (not patch), and monitor IOP daily.
• Screen hyphema patients for sickle cell disease; IOP thresholds are lower and risk is higher.
• Angle recession glaucoma may present years later—long-term follow-up is required after blunt trauma.
• Morning pain with recurrent “abrasions” strongly suggests recurrent corneal erosion.
• Choroidal rupture near the fovea carries delayed CNVM risk—monitor for months after injury.
• Commotio retinae is typically observed, but posterior pole involvement may cause permanent vision loss.
• Orbital compartment syndrome is an ophthalmic emergency—do not delay lateral canthotomy/cantholysis for imaging.
• Immediate optic disc pallor after trauma implies pre-existing optic neuropathy, not acute TON.
• Multiple CN III, IV, VI ± V1/V2 palsies localize to the cavernous sinus—consider CCF or mucormycosis.
• Multilayered retinal hemorrhages in infants indicate abusive head trauma until proven otherwise—mandatory reporting required.
• Sympathetic ophthalmia prevention is only effective before inflammation begins—enucleation offers no benefit once disease is active.
