Phototransduction 

28 flashcards

Phototransduction definition:
1 of 28

when a photon of light is captured by a visual pigment molecule and is transformed into an electrical response in the photoreceptor.

The electrical response that occurs in photoreceptors is always  a_____in response to photon absorption.
2 of 28

hyperpolarization

Photoreceptors are ____ in the dark
3 of 28

depolarized (due to cation channels in the outer segment membrane being open)

In the dark, what neurotransmitter is released in photoreceptor phototransduction?
4 of 28

glutamate

Light stimulation leads to interruption of the dark current and results in (hyperpolarization/ depolarization).
5 of 28

hyperpolarization

The peak absorption of rhodopsin is at _____.
6 of 28

~500nm

The peak absorption of the cones is at ___.
7 of 28

one of three different visual pigments1. long (red) at 5642. medium (green) at 5333. short (blue) at 437

Mnemonic to remember wavelengths of cones:

"THIS IS BS AT ABOUT 4:30" 
"I'M GOING MAD AT ABOUT 5:30PM"
"READY, LEAVING AT ABOUT 5 AFTER 6 O'CLOCK"

Visual pigments (opsins) are located in the membranes of the discs of the outer segment. They are___   bound to a chromophores (11-cis-retinaldehyde).
9 of 28

covalently

The chromophore is derived from vitamin ____.

Are rods "HYPER" or "DE" -polarized in LIGHT?
11 of 28

The rods are HYPERpolarized in light.Rods are hyperpolarized in the light and depolarized in the dark.

Explain the ""HYPER" vs "DE"-polarized states in phototransduction.
12 of 28

1. Dark= Rods are DEpolarized (around -40 mV) because Na+ and Ca++ ions continuously enter the cell through open cyclic GMP (cGMP)-gated channels. This allows for the constant release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.2. Light: CLosure of cGMP-gated channels, reducing Na+ and Ca++ influx. This causes the membrane potential to become more negative (hyperpolarized, around -70 mV)-- reducing glutamate release.

What is the voltage of membrane potential for depolarized VS hyperpolarized photoreceptors?
13 of 28

1. Depolarized= -40mV2. Hyperpolarized= -70mV

Inside rods, there is rhodopsin. Inside the rhodopsin, there is a molecule called retinal. IN THE DARK, RETINAL IS BENT. What is this bent state called?
14 of 28

11-cis retinal 
(BENT IS 11-cis)

Inside rods, there is rhodopsin. 
Inside the rhodopsin, there is a molecule called retinal. 
IN THE LIGHT, RETINAL IS STRAIGHT. This is called _____.
15 of 28

ALL TRANS RETINAL

When light hits the retinal inside the rhodopsin, the retinal become unbent and the  rhodopsin changes shape. 

When rhodopsin change shape, it activates what molecule that is usually attached to rhodopsin?
16 of 28

transducin

Alpha-transducin leaves after light hits rhodopsin and makes rhodopsin change shape.
 
Alpha-transducin then goes and binds with:
17 of 28

GMP Phosphodiesterase (PDE)

In the dark, are Na+ channels in rods OPEN OR CLOSED?
18 of 28

OPEN

When light hits a rod, PDE changes cyclic GMP to regular GMP. 

As a result, what happens to Na+ channels?
19 of 28

Na+ channels close (which in turn hyperpolarizes the cell)

When rods hyperpolarize in light rods turn offâ€“ but what happens to the on-center bipolar cells?
20 of 28

On-center bipolar cells turn ON in light.

Rods vs Cones: Which have disc CONNECTED to them?
21 of 28

CONes are CONnected!

Both start with CON

Describe cGMP's main function in phototransduction.
22 of 28

Keeps Na+ channels open, this allows Na+ to flow into the photoreceptor. 

When light hits, cGMP is turned to GMP so Na+ channels close.

True or False: Glutamate release is decreased during light stimulation of a photoreceptor. This informs the on-bipolar cell that there is a light stimulus.
23 of 28

True. Glutamate decreases in light.

Fields of bipolar cells are ___ shaped.
24 of 28

circular (with the center-ON bipolar cells being ON when there is light, and the center-OFF bipolar cells being active WHEN THERE IS NO LIGHT).

Functions of horizontal cells vs amacrine cells in the retina.
25 of 28

1. horizontal: modulate signals between photoreceptors and bipolar cells.
2.  amacrine: modulate signals between bipolar and ganglion cells.

Mnemonic for horizontal vs amacrine cells:
26 of 28

*HORIZ:* helping opsin readily interpret zany (opsin to zany bipolar) *A CRAZY MARRIAGE* (bipolar is crazy and the G is ganglion)"

Main function of ganglion cells of the retina:
27 of 28

propagation of visual stimuli to the optic nerve.

What is the function of astrocytes at the optic nerve?
28 of 28

metabolic support and potassium regulation
