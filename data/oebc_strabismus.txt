Hypertropia
1 of 20
Definition: Vertical deviation of one eye upward; can be congenital or acquired.
Symptoms: Asymptomatic, diplopia, head tilt, asthenopia, headaches.
Signs: Vertical tropia on cover test; may have reduced stereopsis and abnormal EOMs; if congenital may have amblyopia and increased vertical fusion ranges.
Treatment: Correct refractive error; patching; strabismus surgery in extreme cases.
Follow Up: PRN.

Mobius Syndrome
2 of 20
Definition: Congenital bilateral inability to abduct past midline due to aplasia of CN VI and VII nuclei.
Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic.
Signs: Reduced facial movements (“mask-like face”), epiphora, exposure keratopathy.
Treatment: Treat exposure keratopathy; strabismus surgery.
Follow Up: PRN.

Brown Syndrome
3 of 20
Definition: Congenital or more commonly acquired (inflammation, surgery, trauma) disorder affecting the superior oblique tendon/trochlea complex.
Symptoms: Diplopia in right or left superior gaze.
Signs: Inability of one eye to elevate in adduction; abnormal EOM movement; (+) forced ductions; head tilt.
Treatment: Usually not required; steroids to reduce inflammation (if inflammatory cause suspected).
Follow Up: PRN.

Duane Syndrome
4 of 20
Definition: Congenital aplasia or hypoplasia of the abducens nerve causing reduced lateral rectus action (variable limitation).
Symptoms: Vary based on onset.
Signs: Limited abduction, adduction, or both (usually unilateral, ~85%); globe retraction with narrowing of palpebral fissure on adduction; incomitant deviation with compensatory head turn; may be associated with deafness and limb/vertebral abnormalities.
Types: Type 1 (most common): ET in primary gaze + limited abduction. Type 2 (least common): XT in primary gaze + limited adduction. Type 3: Limited adduction and abduction + significant globe retraction.
Treatment: Usually not required; strabismus surgery if needed.
Follow Up: PRN.

Congenital Esotropia (Infantile Esotropia)
5 of 20
Definition: Large angle deviation (>35 PD) manifesting before 6 months of age.
Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic; cosmetic concerns.
Signs: Deviation on gross exam; typically equal at distance and near; amblyopia if non-alternating; may have associated inferior oblique overaction / DVD; no accommodative component.
Treatment: Fully correct myopia; treat hyperopia > +2.00; strabismus surgery most successful if performed before age 2.
Follow Up: Age-appropriate exams.

Accommodative Esotropia
6 of 20
Epidemiology: Up to ~55% of esotropias have an accommodative component; often intermittent; commonly manifests around age ~2.
Types: Refractive (high hyperopia > +4.75, normal AC/A, distance ≈ near). Non-refractive (normal Rx, high AC/A, near > distance). Mixed (moderate-high hyperopia + high AC/A).
Symptoms: Rubbing/closing one eye at near tasks; may have diplopia.
Signs: Esotropia improves with correction; reduced stereopsis; amblyopia typically only if deviation becomes constant.
Treatment: Full cycloplegic Rx (<6 yrs); >6 yrs give as much plus as tolerated. If residual deviation with high AC/A: executive bifocal +2.50 add with segment line at lower pupil border. Strabismus surgery if optical correction does not resolve deviation.
Follow Up: 3 months for Rx check; 6 months if increasing add power.

Non-Accommodative Esotropia
7 of 20
Definition: Esotropia that does not improve with refractive correction; may have acute onset.
Symptoms: Diplopia initially; longstanding cases may adapt via suppression or anomalous correspondence.
Types: Early onset (6 months–2 years; resembles infantile). Divergence insufficiency (distance > near; constant or intermittent). Decompensated esophoria (often after age ~7 when NFV no longer compensates; constant or intermittent).
Treatment: Refer to rule out neurologic etiology; prescribe full spectacle correction; base-out prism; consider vision therapy; surgery as last resort.
Follow Up: Annual exam or PRN.

Sensory Esotropia
8 of 20
Definition: Esotropia secondary to unilateral reduced vision from an ocular condition (e.g., cataract, corneal scar, ptosis, macular scar, optic atrophy, uncorrected refractive error).
Symptoms: Often complaint of an eye turn.
Signs: Constant unilateral esotropia with poor acuity (approx 20/60 to LP).
Treatment: Visual prognosis often poor; treat primarily for cosmesis.
Follow Up: PRN.

Consecutive Esotropia
9 of 20
Definition: Esotropia occurring after strabismus surgery for exotropia (post-op overcorrection).
Symptoms: Diplopia, asthenopia.
Signs: ET on cover test; may have paradoxical unharmonious anomalous correspondence.
Treatment: Prism to place image into suppression zone.
Follow Up: 6-week check if prism Rx; otherwise annual/PRN.

Prominent Epicanthal Folds
10 of 20
Definition: Pseudostrabismus appearance that can mimic esotropia.
Symptoms: Parent concern for eye turn.
Signs: No deviation on cover test; equal Hirschberg reflex.
Treatment: No treatment.
Follow Up: Annual exam.

Intermittent Exotropia
11 of 20
Definition: Most common exodeviation; can be triggered by bright light, anxiety, fatigue, inattention, or poor health.
Symptoms: Child may close deviated eye outdoors; older patients may report asthenopia, headaches, diplopia, photophobia, difficulty reading.
Signs: XT on cover test; amblyopia is rare.
Subtypes: Basic exotropia; divergence excess; convergence insufficiency.
Treatment: Correct refractive error; vision therapy; base-in prism; strabismus surgery if conservative measures fail.
Follow Up: As needed.

Congenital Exotropia
12 of 20
Definition: Exotropia manifesting before 1 year of age.
Signs: Usually constant alternating; normal accommodation; minimal refractive error.
Treatment: Correct refractive error as needed; consider VT and/or base-in prism; surgery if conservative measures fail.
Follow Up: As needed.

Decompensated Exophoria
13 of 20
Definition: Positive fusional vergence can no longer compensate, leading to intermittent or constant exotropia; often occurs with early presbyopia.
Symptoms: Diplopia, asthenopia.
Signs: XT on cover test.
Treatment: Correct refractive error; vision therapy; base-in prism; surgery if needed.
Follow Up: As needed.

Consecutive Exotropia
14 of 20
Definition: Exotropia after strabismus surgery for esotropia (post-op overcorrection).
Symptoms: Diplopia, asthenopia.
Signs: XT on cover test; may have paradoxical anomalous correspondence (unharmonious/harmonious).
Treatment: Correct refractive error; consider prism and/or vision therapy; surgery if needed.
Follow Up: As needed.

A-Pattern Tropia
15 of 20
Definition: More exo (or less eso) in downgaze and less exo (or more eso) in upgaze.
Compensation: Chin tilt may be present.
Workup: Quantify deviation in upgaze/primary/downgaze; assess oblique dysfunction.
Treatment: Manage underlying pattern/oblique involvement; consider surgical referral when significant.
Follow Up: PRN.

V-Pattern Tropia
16 of 20
Definition: Opposite of A-pattern (typically more exo in upgaze and more eso in downgaze).
Workup: Compare deviations in upgaze vs downgaze; evaluate oblique function.
Treatment: Address refractive needs; consider VT/prism in select cases; surgical referral if significant.
Follow Up: PRN.

X-Pattern Tropia
17 of 20
Definition: More exo in both upgaze and downgaze.
Workup: Measure in multiple gaze positions; look for oblique dysfunction.
Treatment: Individualized; consider referral for surgical evaluation if large/symptomatic.
Follow Up: PRN.

Maddox Rod Test
18 of 20
Concept: Indirect projection test of ocular alignment (example given with red Maddox over right eye).
Interpretation (as written): Exo → line left of light; Eso → line right of light; Hyper → line below light; Hypo → line above light.
Clinical Pearl: Always document which eye has the Maddox rod and the line orientation; confirm with prism neutralization if needed.
Follow Up: PRN.

Hering–Bielschowsky Afterimage Test
19 of 20
Concept: Vertical line flashed on deviated eye; perceived cross alignment helps assess correspondence.
Interpretation (as written): Cross = no deviation or HAC with a deviation. Esotropia reports vertical line opposite the deviated eye. UAC shows an offset cross but subjective angle (>A) will not equal objective deviation (>O). PUAC reports >A greater than >O.
Clinical Pearl: Use alongside cover testing and sensory tests—correspondence findings should match the clinical picture.
Follow Up: PRN.

Bagolini Striated Lenses
20 of 20
Concept: Sensory fusion/correspondence test using striations (as written: right eye sees top-right line; left eye sees top-left line).
Interpretation (as written): Exo → two lights below; Eso → two lights above. Suppression → missing/segmented line. HAC → one light with an “X” while deviation remains present.
Clinical Pearl: Bagolini often reflects “real-world” sensory status; compare with Worth 4-dot and cover test.
Follow Up: PRN.

Strabismus – High-Yield Clinical Pearls
21 of 20
• Constant infantile esotropia (>35 PD, onset <6 months) has NO accommodative component and is best treated surgically before age 2.
• Accommodative esotropia improves with full cycloplegic hyperopic correction; near > distance deviation suggests a high AC/A ratio → consider bifocals.
• Intermittent exotropia commonly worsens with fatigue, illness, or bright light; amblyopia is rare.
• Duane syndrome shows globe retraction and palpebral fissure narrowing on adduction due to co-contraction.
• Brown syndrome = inability to elevate in adduction with a (+) forced duction test.
• Sensory strabismus results from unilateral vision loss—treatment is primarily cosmetic.
• Consecutive deviations occur after strabismus surgery and may cause paradoxical anomalous correspondence.
• Pseudostrabismus (e.g., epicanthal folds) has normal cover test and symmetric corneal light reflexes.
• Vertical deviations often produce compensatory head tilt; long-standing congenital cases may lack diplopia.
• Always correlate sensory tests (Bagolini, Maddox rod, afterimages) with the cover test—objective findings come first.
