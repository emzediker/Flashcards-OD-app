Hypertropia
1 of 20
Definition: Vertical deviation of one eye upward; can be congenital or acquired.

Signs: Vertical tropia on cover test; may have reduced stereopsis and abnormal EOMs; if congenital may have amblyopia and increased vertical fusion ranges.
Treatment: Correct refractive error; patching; strabismus surgery in extreme cases.

Signs: Limited abduction, adduction, or both (usually unilateral, ~85%); globe retraction with narrowing of palpebral fissure on adduction; incomitant deviation with compensatory head turn; may be associated with deafness and limb/vertebral abnormalities.
Types: Type 1 (most common): ET in primary gaze + limited abduction. Type 2 (least common): XT in primary gaze + limited adduction. Type 3: Limited adduction and abduction + significant globe retraction.
Treatment: Usually not required; strabismus surgery if needed.

Congenital Esotropia
5 of 20
AKA: Infantile esotropia.
Definition: Large angle deviation (>35 PD) manifesting before 6 months of age.
Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic; cosmetic concerns.
Signs: Deviation on gross exam; typically equal at distance and near; amblyopia if non-alternating; may have associated inferior oblique overaction / DVD; no accommodative component.
Treatment: Fully correct myopia; treat hyperopia > +2.00; strabismus surgery most successful if performed before age 2.
Follow Up: Age-appropriate exams.  [oai_citation:4‡13 Strabismus.docx](sediment://file_0000000077fc71fd8d48419f5ac62ba9)

Accommodative Esotropia
6 of 20
Epidemiology: Up to ~55% of esotropias have an accommodative component; often intermittent; commonly manifests around age ~2.
Types: Refractive (high hyperopia > +4.75, normal AC/A, distance ≈ near). Non-refractive (normal Rx, high AC/A, near > distance). Mixed (moderate-high hyperopia + high AC/A).
Symptoms: Rubbing/closing one eye at near tasks; may have diplopia.
Signs: Esotropia improves with correction; reduced stereopsis; amblyopia typically only if deviation becomes constant.
Treatment: Full cycloplegic Rx (<6 yrs); >6 yrs give as much plus as tolerated. If residual deviation with high AC/A: executive bifocal +2.50 add with segment line at lower pupil border. Strabismus surgery if optical correction does not resolve deviation.
Follow Up: 3 months for Rx check; 6 months if increasing add power.  [oai_citation:5‡13 Strabismus.docx](sediment://file_0000000077fc71fd8d48419f5ac62ba9)

Non-Accommodative Esotropia
7 of 20
Definition: Esotropia that does not improve with refractive correction; may have acute onset.
Symptoms: Diplopia initially; longstanding cases may adapt via suppression or anomalous correspondence.
Types: Early onset (6 months–2 years; resembles infantile). Divergence insufficiency (distance > near; constant or intermittent). Decompensated esophoria (often after age ~7 when NFV no longer compensates; constant or intermittent).
Treatment: Refer to rule out neurologic etiology; prescribe full spectacle correction; base-out prism; consider vision therapy; surgery as last resort.
Follow Up: Annual exam or PRN.  [oai_citation:6‡13 Strabismus.docx](sediment://file_0000000077fc71fd8d48419f5ac62ba9)

Sensory Esotropia
8 of 20
Definition: Esotropia secondary to unilateral reduced vision from an ocular condition (e.g., cataract, corneal scar, ptosis, macular scar, optic atrophy, uncorrected refractive error).
Symptoms: Often complaint of an eye turn.
Signs: Constant unilateral esotropia with poor acuity (approx 20/60 to LP).
Treatment: Visual prognosis often poor; treat primarily for cosmesis.

A-Pattern Tropia
15 of 20
Definition: More exo (or less eso) in downgaze and less exo (or more eso) in upgaze.
Compensation: Chin tilt may be present.
Workup: Quantify deviation in upgaze/primary/downgaze; assess oblique dysfunction.

Follow Up: PRN.  [oai_citation:14‡13 Strabismus.docx](sediment://file_0000000077fc71fd8d48419f5ac62ba9)

V-Pattern Tropia
16 of 20
Definition: Opposite of A-pattern (typically more exo in upgaze and more eso in downgaze).
Workup: Compare deviations in upgaze vs downgaze; evaluate oblique function.
Treatment: Address refractive needs; consider VT/prism in select cases; surgical referral if significant.
Follow Up: PRN.  [oai_citation:15‡13 Strabismus.docx](sediment://file_0000000077fc71fd8d48419f5ac62ba9)

Maddox Rod Tes
18 of 20
Concept: Indirect projection test of ocular alignment (example given with red Maddox over right eye).
Interpretation (as written): Exo → line left of light; Eso → line right of light; Hyper → line below light; Hypo → line above light.
Clinical Pearl: Always document which eye has the Maddox rod and the line orientation; confirm with prism neutralization if needed.

Hering–Bielschowsky Afterimage Test
19 of 20
Concept: Vertical line flashed on deviated eye; perceived cross alignment helps assess correspondence.
Interpretation (as written): Cross = no deviation or HAC with a deviation. Esotropia reports vertical line opposite the deviated eye. UAC shows an offset cross but subjective angle (>A) will not equal objective deviation (>O). PUAC reports >A greater than >O.
Clinical Pearl: Use alongside cover testing and sensory tests—correspondence findings should match the clinical picture.

Bagolini Striated Lense
20 of 20
Concept: Sensory fusion/correspondence test using striations (as written: right eye sees top-right line; left eye sees top-left line).
Interpretation (as written): Exo → two lights below; Eso → two lights above. Suppression → missing/segmented line. HAC → one light with an “X” while deviation remains present.
Clinical Pearl: Bagolini often reflects “real-world” sensory status; compare with Worth 4-dot and cover test.
