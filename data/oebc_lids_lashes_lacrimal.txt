Clinical Pearls – Lids, Lashes, Lacrimal System, Ocular Adnexa & Orbit
34 of 33
Clinical Pearls:
• Pain with eye movements, vision loss, RAPD, color vision defects, or suspected abscess strongly indicate orbital cellulitis rather than preseptal cellulitis and require immediate ER referral and IV antibiotics.
• Absence of pain with eye movements, RAPD, and vision loss supports preseptal cellulitis rather than orbital cellulitis.
• Recurrent chalazion in the same exact eyelid location is suspicious for sebaceous gland carcinoma and warrants biopsy or referral.
• Canaliculitis is classically associated with a tender, pouting punctum and expressible white discharge or concretions, often due to Actinomyces.
• Acute dacryocystitis should NOT be probed during active infection due to risk of orbital spread; treat infection first and monitor closely.
• Floppy eyelid syndrome has a strong association with obstructive sleep apnea and should prompt systemic screening, not just ocular surface treatment.
• In thyroid eye disease, smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor.
• In thyroid eye disease, reduced color vision, visual field loss, or decreased acuity suggests optic nerve compression and requires urgent evaluation.
• Recurrent or nonresolving eyelid lesions, especially with madarosis or poliosis, should raise concern for malignancy rather than benign inflammatory disease.
