35 flashcards

There are 3 germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Which germ layer does not contribute to the eye?
1 of 35

endoderm

Neurulation definition

Folding of germ layers

Which embryonic layer folds in on itself (aka invaginates) to form the neural tube?
3 of 35

ectoderm

When the ectoderm folds in on itself, what structure is formed?
4 of 35

Neural Tube - This is a long tube from head to butt that forms the nervous system. Near the head, the neural tube makes a large outpouch called the forebrain and two small outpouchings CALLED ___THAT MAKE THE EYE.
5 of 35

optic vesicles/ optic grooves

Surface ECTODERM pinches off and isolates itself to form a lens placode that leads to the formation of:
6 of 35

crystalline lens

The main things ectoderm makes are:
7 of 35

anything epithelial, accessory lacrimal glands, crystalline lens, retina 

The main things mesoderm makes are:
8 of 35

cornea, sclera, uvea, hyaloid artery

The main thing endoderm makes in the eye is:

Trick question. NOTHING EYE SPECIFIC

Week 6 of gestation marks the following event:
10 of 35

lens placode invaginates and makes lens vesicle/ crystalline lens

At __ months gestation  the eyelids split into two structures but stay sealed shut, then at __ months the eyelids separate.
11 of 35

5 months they form two structures8 months they separate

TRUE OR FALSE: The lacrimal gland is functioning at birth.
12 of 35

FALSE Remember babies are born without tears when they cry. It can take 2 weeks to 2 months after birth to form tears.

Is the cornea thinner at birth or in adulthood?
13 of 35

Surprisingly the cornea is an average of 573 microns at birth and thins with age.

Most of the uvea is mesodermal. What makes the iris unique  in its gestation process?
14 of 35

The anterior iris portion (the stroma) is of mesoderm, but the two posterior layers are of neuroectoderm.

The first sign of vitreal formation occurs during at ____weeks gestation.
15 of 35

4 weeks

The hyaloid artery feeds the retina until month____ of gestation, then the retinal arteries start to form.

The fovea is present at birth, but not mature until:
17 of 35

4-5 years old

What is the neural tube and when does it start to elongate?
18 of 35

The neural tube forms the spine and brain (and optic vesicles) and starts to elongate at 28 days (1 month) after conception.

NEURAL ectoderm folds in on itself (KNOW THIS MAKES IT APEX TO APEX)  to create:

neural retina / RPE

Neural crest definition:
20 of 35

ball of cells prior to becoming neural tube

Ependyma definition:
21 of 35

Thin neuroepithelial layer of the ventricular system of the brain and spinal cord.

Notochord definition:
22 of 35

Neural tube prior to it being closed.

When do orbit bones start to form in utero?
23 of 35

Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells begin to ossify in the sixth gestational week.

Orbital sutures close by:
24 of 35

2 to 12 YEARS old. This is when the bones of the orbit finally fully fuse.

Describe the mesenchymal condensation process:
25 of 35

Previously dispersed connective tissue cells compact into a tightly packed cell mass.

Motor innervation development occurs at the following time in life: 	
26 of 35

3-6 months after birth

Ectoderm vs mesoderm (parts of the eye)
27 of 35

ectoderm forms skin, glands, conjunctiva / mesoderm forma tarsus, orbital septum, orbicularis oculi, aponeurosis of levator, smooth muscle

Lacrimal gland and accessory glands come from:
28 of 35

surface ectoderm

The cornea is unique in that its 3 main layers come from different embryological structures. List them.
29 of 35

1.epithelium (derived from surface ectoderm) 2.central stroma layer ( derived from mesenchyme) 3.interior endothelium derived from neural crest cells

The sensory nerves that abundantly innervate the corneal stroma and epithelium originate from:
30 of 35

neural crest cells

Stages of crystalline lens formation:

First is placode, then lens pit, then lens vesicle.

Quiz yourself major properties of each germ layer.
