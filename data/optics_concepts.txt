16 of 239


If you move a lens away from the eye (toward the tip of the nose), what effective power are you inducing?
17 of 239

A lens that moves away BECOMES MORE POWERFUL PLUS.
Ex. +4.00 at eye = +4.25 at tip of nose
Ex. -4.00 at eye = -3.75 at tip of nose
WHERE THE LENS SITS CHANGES HOW POWERFUL IT ACTS.

If you move a lens closer in towards the eye (or up the bridge of the nose) towards, what effective power are you inducing?
18 of 239

A lens that moves towards BECOMES MORE POWERFUL MINUS.

Ex. +7.00 at eye = +6.75 at bridge of nose

Rule of thumb: Minus vs plus when does a lens become more EFFECTIVELY POWERFUL?
19 of 239

For plus lens: moving the lens away from the eye increases its effective power to a more + power.

For minus lens: moving the lens away from the eyes decreases its effective power to a more - power.

22 of 239

Changing corrective lenses from spectacles to contact lenses decreases the vertex distance between the lenses and the eye.

The movement of that prescription alone makes the lens (effectively)a bit more minus.

…You don't have to include all that induced minus, so adjust the prescription.

Quick math: Between 4 D to 6 D (either sign + or -), about how much difference in spectacle to contact lens power adjustments need to be made?
23 of 239

GO MORE PLUS BY 0.50D.

A -5.00 D spectacle prescription will need to be adjusted to a -4.50 for the correct contact lens prescription.

Quick math: At 6 D ore greater (either sign + or -) how much does a contact lens prescription need to be adjusted from the glasses prescription in order to account for effective power?
24 of 239

The contact lens prescription needs to be MORE PLUS BY 1.00D.

JUST REMEMBER OR WRITE IT BEFORE STARTING THE TEST! 14,7,5,3,2 say it out loud! 14,7,5,3,2 means each 0.25 to 0.50 jump, tolerance will change to these numbers.

The most important ANSI axis degree tolerance to learn is:
154 of 239

Greater than (NOT EQUAL TO) 1.50 is only 2 degrees up or down.

Impact lenses in agreement with ANSI standards resist a ___ size ball dropped from ___.
155 of 239

⅝ inch steel ball from 50 INCHES

Differentiate high-mass impact vs high-velocity impact grading of lenses or frames
156 of 239

IMPACT IS MARKED WITH A "+"HIGH MASS= pointed projectile weighing 500g dropped from 50 inches

HIGH VELOCITY: 0.25 steel ball fired at 150 ft/second

Describe a meniscus lens:
157 of 239

convex front surface and concave back surface

Describe a toric lens:
158 of 239

one spherical component one cylindrical component

Describe the A vs B in the boxing system of frame measurements.
159 of 239

A is the HORIZONTAL measurement (from edge of outside line of the frame- not lens).
B is the VERTICAL measurement.

The major reference point (MRP) of a spectacle lens is:
160 of 239

the visual axis (usually measured at the pupil)

Describe the seg drop of a bifocal.
161 of 239

The measurement from major reference point (MRP) to the top of the seg height.

If the segment line is placed too high on the lens, what can be done to the tilt of frame to fix this?
162 of 239

Think: the line is in their vision, so induce pantoscopic tilt downward to lower the bifocal line out of the  line of sight.

If the seg line is placed to low on a lens, what can be done to the nose pads of a frame to correct it?
163 of 239

Think: You need to "jump" the line up. By pinching or narrowing the nose pads it raises up the frame to a higher, more narrow part of the nose.

What can be done to the frame bridge if the segment line is too low?
164 of 239

Think: You change the same basic mechanics as what you would do to nose pads. So if the seg is low you would narrow the nose pads- so you can also narrow the bridge to achieve the same result.

Can there ever be vertical imbalance in contact lens?
165 of 239

No, pupils move with the lenses so no vertical imbalance in can be induced with contact lenses.

1D of the power difference between eyes is equal to how much aniseikonia?
166 of 239

1% aniseikonia- THIS IS A RULE OF THUMB

Define antimetropia.
167 of 239

One eye hyperopic and one eye myopic

When is a bitoric gas permeable lens (cylinder correction on the front surface and back surface) needed?
168 of 239

After 2.50D of astigmatism

Describe the saddleback surface bitoric is fit:
169 of 239

0.25 flatter than corneal keratometry in both meridians.

Describe prism ballast in gas permeable contact lenses.
170 of 239

Base down prism is added to a rigid gas permeable lens for WEIGHT to keep the lens from rotating.

Mnemonic to remember causes of flexure.
171 of 239

FLOATS (flexure loves oxygen, astigmatism, thin, steep)

Under what center thickness is more flexure likely to occur?
172 of 239

~0.15mm

If keratometry readings are toric over an RGP, what does that indicate?
173 of 239

Lens flexure

The Dk of old PMMA material is:
174 of 239

0 ZERO! (Think: lots of corneal edema results!)

List the patient with the highest need for high Dk lenes: myopes, aphakes, hyperopes.
175 of 239

Aphakic patients need the highest (Dk 100+).

Hyperopes need moderate Dk.

Myopes can get by with the lowest Dk.

Differentiate changing base curve values (steeper or flatter) in soft contact lenses vs rigid gas permeable lenses.
176 of 239

There is NO "lacrimal lens" power in soft contacts, so altering the base curve (steeper or flatter) not change the power of soft contact.

In gas permeables lenses the "lacrimal lens" power with increase or decrease with base curve changes so you need to adjust with "SAM FAP"

Describe
Truncation of rigid
 gas permeable
contact lenses
177 of 239

Cutting the bottom portion of the gas permeable lens off so it sits flat to the lower lid.  Truncation is made for bifocal contact lenses that the lid can push to move the add power up as the patient looks down to read.

In toric contact lens fitting, Is "LARS" considered from the patient's view or the doctor's view?
178 of 239

Doctor's view. If the lens rotates to the left then add the degrees rotated to the axis power to get the final prescription vs if the lens is rotated to the right subtract insead.

LARS = Left ADD Right SUBTRACT

High modulus soft contact lens means:
179 of 239

Highly stiff or rigid (more water content lowers the modulus to become less rigid).

High modulus (more rigid) contact lenses can be easier to handle.

What are the cons of high modulus lenses?
180 of 239

Increase cases of GPC (giant papillary conjunctivitis) and SEALS (superior epithelial arcuate lesions)

Hyperopes vs Myopes

Who accommodates more with spectacles or contact lenses.
181 of 239

DRAW AN H,THE LETTER LOOKS MORE LIKE GLASSES WITH THE BRIDGE.
Hyperopes accommodate more with spectacles.Myopes accommodate more in contact lenses.

Why would a myope need reading glasses over their contact lenses even if they do not have a bifocal in their glasses yet.
182 of 239

Myopes accommodate more in contact lenses than in glasses, so when accommodation abilities decrease in presbyopia, they need more help at near while wearing contacts first.

Do hyperopes get a bigger image with contact lenses or spectacles?
183 of 239

Spectacles create a bigger image size for hyperopes.

Not only do glasses make a bigger image size in hyperopes, they also have a greater accommodative demand and convergence demand.

Mnemonic for Keplerian vs Galilean telescopes.
184 of 239

1. F* KEPLIN= -FOV (high FOV)-keep everything plus -longer -inverted -not real
 2. GALILEAN: "U REAL GAL"  (upright, real image, Galilean alternating lenses)

Properties of Keplerian telescope.
185 of 239

*F* KEPLIN
 F=High Field of view
KEP= Keep Everything Plus (two plus lenses)
 L= longer in length

I= Inverted image is inverted (so they need an extra mirror to flip it)
N= Not real image
(it's virtual image)

Properties of Galilean telescope.
186 of 239

U REAL GAL= 
U= upright
REAL= Real image
GAL= Galilean is alternating lenses (one plus & one minus)

The reverse telescope is made of what system?
187 of 239

Galilean

The reverse telescope is made to assist patients with type of eye diseases?
188 of 239

Conditions associated with peripheral vision loss: ie retinitis pigmentosa or glaucoma with tunnel vision

The goal of reverse telescopes is:
189 of 239

to expand the patients field of view

Ex. In a 4x reverse telescope, a 5 degree field of view is now 20 degrees. So they can so a wider view of a room instead of feeling like they are looking through a small tube. HOWEVER they MINIFY the SIZE of EVERYTHING by 4x also!

A patient has a lateral hemianopia. Where does the prism go on the spectacles to try "open up" the vision.
190 of 239

BASE  TOWARD DANGER ZONE. The base of the prism always goes toward the same side of the defect. Think: now the image will go toward the apex.

In the treatment of an hemianopia with prism, how many degrees will the visual field SHIFT per prism diopter prescribed?
191 of 239

1 degree = 2 Prism Diopters
(so 0.5 degrees per 1 prism diopter)

List the definition of legal blindness in the United States.
192 of 239

The patient cannot see 20/100 or better in their "good" eye or the patient only has a visual field of  20 degrees or less in their "good" eye.

High powered (+4.00 and over) reading glasses used in low vision require what base prism?
193 of 239

Base-IN (BI) prism will reduce demand on convergence

EFFECTIVE POWER OF MINUS AND PLUS LENS:

WHEN DOES EFFECTIVE POWER INCREASE FOR EACH?
201 of 239

When a plus lens is moved away from the eyes it increases the effective power.
When a minus lens is moved toward the eye it increases the effective power.

PLUS LENS EFFECTIVE POWER RULE OF THUMB
202 of 239

Have you ever seen a presbyope take their lenses and sit it on end of nose (like Santa Claus?)

They are asking for more power (they are inducing more effective power by moving plus away).
THINK: Contact lenses require MORE PLUS than glasses. +10.00 spectacles "vertex" to +10.50 contacts). There is less effective power at the cornea, so the contact needs more power in the lens to make up for the loss in effective power.

Minus lens effective power rule of thumb:
203 of 239

Think: a minus lens "vertexes" from -6.00D in  spectacles to -5.50D in contact lenses.
There must be more effective power closer to the eye if the contact lens needs less power to make the same effect.

The effective power of a contact lens is stronger closer toward the cornea, so the extra power in a contact lens needs to be reduced.


Near Point of Accommodation (NPA)

204 of 239

Refractive error + accommodation to see how close someone can see something clearly. -3.00D myope can see well at near. They can see even more at near when they add accommodation.

Negative Relative Accommodation
205 of 239

The maximum amount of PLUS (OFTEN EQUAL TO THEIR ADD) lenses a patient will accept to see letters clearly.It's called negative because you relax their accommodation to see clearly.

Positive Relative Accommodation (PRA)
206 of 239

The maximum amount of negative lenses you can put over a patient's eyes and they can still see letters clearly.Called positive because you are inducing their accommodation to work harder.

With a lensometer, do we measure front or back vertex power?
207 of 239

back

Does a myope ?PUSH OR PULL? SPECTACLES ?to/ from? the eye to increase lens effectivity?
208 of 239

Myopes push spectacles toward the eye to artificially induce more minus and "make them stronger."

This means spectacles are too weak and they need more power induced to clear things up.

SHORTCUT: The values a hyperope's spectacles vertex to contact lenses.
209 of 239

0-4.00D: Negligible- less than 0.25D MORE PLUS (ie +2.75 spec goes to +2.82 CL).
4.25-5.75D: Add +0.50 more plus to the contact lens Rx compared to the spectacle Rx.
6-10.00D: Add +0.75 more plus to contact lens Rx compared to the spectacle Rx.

SHORTCUT: The values a myope's spectacles vertex to contact lenses.

210 of 239

0-4:00D - Negligible - ADD MORE PLUS TO THE CONTACT LENS (OR LESS MINUS) by 0.25 (ie a -2.50D spectacle Rx changes to to - 2.30D in contact lenses)
4.25-5.75D- Add +0.50 to the spectacle Rx  to get the best contact lens Rx ( -5.00 spec Rx changes to -4.50 CL)
6-10.00D: Add +0.75  to the spectacle Rx to get the best contact lens Rx (-6.50 goes to a -5.75CL)

Differentiate irregular astigmatism vs oblique astigmatism
212 of 239

Irregular: Meridians are NOT 90 degrees away from each other.
Oblique: the meridians LAND OUTSIDE THE NORMAL 30 degree range to one side of the 180 or 90 (ie 40-70 is not within 30 degree of major meridians)

Concave mirror: What does the image look like if the object is INSIDE THE FOCAL LENGTH?
222 of 239

CONCAVE MIRROR:If the object is INSIDE THE FOCAL LENGTH, the image is VIRTUAL. ERECT & MAGNIFIED.

True or false. Images created by CONVEX MIRRORS have different sizes and orientations depending on where the object is relative to the mirros focal length.
223 of 239

FALSE A convex mirror forms only virtual images that are erect and smaller than  their object.It does not matter if inside or outside of  the focal length.

Give a real world example of a convex mirror.
