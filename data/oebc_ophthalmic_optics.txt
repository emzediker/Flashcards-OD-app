Ophthalmic Optics – Lens Materials
1 of 12
CR-39: Refractive Index 1.498; Abbe 58; Pros: lightweight, good optics; Cons: thick lenses, scratches easily.
Crown Glass: Refractive Index 1.523; Abbe 59; Pros: excellent optics, scratch resistant; Cons: heavy, thick, shatters easily.
Trivex: Refractive Index ~1.53; Abbe 43–45; Pros: impact resistant, safe; Cons: thick lenses, expensive.
Polycarbonate: Refractive Index 1.586; Abbe 30; Pros: thin, light, impact resistant; Cons: scratches easily, significant chromatic aberration.
High-Index Materials: Refractive Index 1.54–1.66; Abbe 32–36; Pros: thin, lightweight; Cons: scratches easily, increased chromatic aberration.

Lenticular Aberrations
2 of 12
Spherical Aberration: Peripheral rays focus at a different point than central rays, causing blur.
Radial (Oblique) Astigmatism: Oblique light rays form two focal lines; reduced using Tscherning ellipse.
Coma: Off-axis object appears comet-shaped due to asymmetric magnification.
Chromatic Aberration: Different wavelengths refract at different angles; higher Abbe value = less CA; reduced by decreasing vertex distance and increasing pantascopic tilt.
Curvature of Field: Effective lens power changes away from optical center; managed by adjusting base curve.

Frame and Lens Selection
3 of 12
High Refractive Error: Use small, round frames and high-index materials to reduce thickness and weight.
Safety Recommendation: Polycarbonate should be recommended for children, police, and firefighters; rimless frames should be avoided.
PAL Frames: Require larger B measurement and appropriate pantascopic tilt.
PAL Design Options: Short corridor PALs for small frames; premium PALs provide wider channels and reduced peripheral aberrations.

Induced Astigmatism
4 of 12
Sphere Power: Always increases (more plus or more minus).
Cylinder Power: Induced in same sign as lens power.
Face Form Tilt: Induces astigmatism at axis 090.
Pantascopic Tilt: Induces astigmatism at axis 180.

Optical Measurements – Inset Calculations
5 of 12
Inset Formula: (FPD − DPD) ÷ 2.
Seg Inset: (DPD − NPD) ÷ 2.
Total Inset: (FPD − NPD) ÷ 2.
Calculated AC/A Ratio: DPD − 0.4(NCT − DCT).

Segment Height Measurements
6 of 12
Bifocal Segment Height: Lower eyelid margin.
Trifocal Segment Height: Bottom of pupil.
PAL Segment Height: Center of pupil.

Frame Adjustments – Pantascopic Tilt
7 of 12
Pantascopic Tilt Effect: Lowers effective lens position.
PAL Impact: Increases usable reading area when appropriate pantascopic tilt is applied.

Spectacle Magnification
8 of 12
Myopes: Experience more magnification as lens moves closer to eye; maximum with contact lenses; require more accommodation in contacts.
Hyperopes: Opposite relationship compared to myopes.

Factors Increasing Magnification
9 of 12
Increase Plus Power.
Increase Center Thickness.
Steepen Base Curve.
Increase Vertex Distance for Plus Lenses.
Decrease Vertex Distance for Minus Lenses.
Opposite changes produce minification.

Field of View
10 of 12
Plus Lenses: Increased plus power decreases field of view.

Reflectance and Transmittance
11 of 12
Reflectance Formula: [(n2 − n1) / (n2 + n1)]².
Transmittance: 1 − Reflectance.
Total Transmittance: Surface 1 × Surface 2 × Material Transmittance.

Slab-Off and Image Jump
12 of 12
Slab-Off: Applied to the most minus lens; reverse slab-off applied to most plus lens.
Prism Equivalence: Slab-off equals base-up prism.
Image Jump: Calculated using Prentice’s Rule and distance to segment optical center.
Executive Bifocal: No image jump.
FT-28: ~5 mm image jump.
Round Segment: Image jump equals half the segment diameter; usually the greatest image jump.

Clinical Pearls – Ophthalmic Optics
13 of 12
• Higher Abbe value lenses produce less chromatic aberration.
• Polycarbonate is thin and impact resistant but produces the most chromatic aberration.
• High refractive errors benefit from small, round frames with high-index materials.
• Pantascopic tilt and vertex distance significantly affect aberrations and magnification.
• Executive bifocals eliminate image jump entirely.
• Slab-off correction is equivalent to base-up prism.
• Premium PALs reduce peripheral aberrations and widen usable visual channels.
