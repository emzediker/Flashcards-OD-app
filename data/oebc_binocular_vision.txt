Percival’s Criterion (Middle 1/3 Rule)
1 of 34
Purpose: Determines whether prism is needed based on vergence ranges; best suited for eso postures (less reliable for exo).
Rule: Prism needed if the “middle 1/3” of the total vergence range does NOT include 0.
How to check (example): If BI = 12 and BO = 30, middle third = +2 to +16; because 0 is not included → prism indicated.

Sheard’s Criterion
2 of 34
Purpose: Determines prism needed when phoria is not compensated; works better for exo postures.
Rule: Compensating vergence should be ≥ 2× phoria.
Prism calculation concept: Uses the relationship “2/3 phoria – 1/3 compensating vergence” to estimate prism needed when Sheard’s is failing.

Basic Exophoria
3 of 34
Definition: Nearly the same exo posture at distance and near.
Symptoms: Near blur and/or diplopia, asthenopia, headaches, poor concentration.
Signs: Exo on cover test; low MEM (possible lead); difficulty with BO lenses; struggle with plus lenses.
Treatment: Do not Rx low hyperopes; fully correct myopes; if symptomatic refer for vision therapy.
Follow-Up: Annual.

Basic Esophoria
4 of 34
Definition: Nearly the same eso posture at distance and near.
Symptoms: Similar to basic exophoria (blur/diplopia, asthenopia, headaches, poor concentration).
Signs: Eso on cover test; high MEM; struggle with minus lenses.
Treatment: Rx as much plus as possible; ensure myopes are not over-corrected; consider near add; BO prism; refer for vision therapy.
Follow-Up: 3 months if treating.

Convergence Insufficiency
5 of 34
Definition: Reduced near convergence (notable for reduced NPC); low AC/A.
Symptoms: Difficulty reading, asthenopia, diplopia, blurred vision, words “move” on page.
Signs: Low AC/A; lead of accommodation; reduced NBO with normal or reduced DBO; reduced NRA; struggle with binocular plus (not monocular).
Treatment: Fully correct myopes; under-correct hyperopes; refer for vision therapy; near reading glasses with BI prism may help.
Follow-Up: PRN.

Convergence Excess
6 of 34
Definition: Eso posture at near with normal distance posture; typically high AC/A.
Symptoms: Similar to CI (near strain/blur/diplopia).
Signs: Near eso > distance by ≥ 5Δ; low MEM; reduced PRA/struggle with minus; struggle with BI prism at near; binocular minus lens difficulty on accommodative facility.
Treatment: Full spectacle Rx with near add (often adequate for high AC/A); refer for vision therapy.
Follow-Up: 1–3 months after new Rx if add given.

Divergence Insufficiency
7 of 34
Definition: Least common vergence condition; low AC/A; distance eso problem.
Symptoms: Diplopia/asthenopia with prolonged distance activities, worse later in day.
Signs: Eso at distance > near by > 5Δ; low AC/A; low BI at distance; near testing otherwise normal.
Treatment: Rx as much plus as possible (spectacle lenses have little therapeutic effect); BO prism for distance; refer for vision therapy.
Follow-Up: PRN.

Divergence Excess
8 of 34
Definition: Distance exo problem; typically high AC/A.
Symptoms: Parents may report eye turning out; children may close one eye in bright light.
Signs: Exo at distance > near by > 5Δ; struggle with DBO; near tests normal.
Treatment: Fully correct myopes; only correct hyperopia to +1.50 (to keep accommodating); extra minus for distance with small add may be an option; vision therapy is very successful.
Follow-Up: PRN.

Accommodative Insufficiency
9 of 34
Definition: Inadequate accommodation (young patient presents like presbyopia).
Symptoms: Near blur, headaches, eyestrain with reading; trouble sustaining attention at near.

Treatment: Near add; vision therapy for accommodative speed/accuracy/flexibility.
Follow-Up: PRN.

Ill-Sustained Accommodation
10 of 34
Definition: Like accommodative insufficiency, but initial testing may appear normal; performance progressively declines with time/fatigue.
Symptoms/Signs: Same pattern as accommodative insufficiency, worsening during sustained near tasks.
Treatment: Similar to accommodative insufficiency (add and/or VT based on symptoms/testing).
Follow-Up: PRN.

Accommodative Excess / Accommodative Spasm
11 of 34
Definition: Inability to relax accommodation.
Symptoms: Near asthenopia/headache; distance blur after near work.

Treatment: Vision therapy targeting accommodative flexibility.
Follow-Up: PRN.

Follow-Up: 6 weeks.

CN III Palsy
14 of 34
Key Point: Innervates SR, IR, MR, IO, levator.
Symptoms: Diplopia and ptosis.
Signs: “Down and out” eye, limited motility, complete ptosis; if pupil involved suspect aneurysm (PCom/PCA region described) near ICA junction; pupil-sparing suggests microvascular ischemia (also consider GCA/cavernous sinus syndrome per context).
Treatment: Treat underlying disease; urgent imaging if pupil involved.
Follow-Up: Refer to internist; if pupil-sparing follow closely for 1 week; emergent MRI if pupil involved.

Signs: Eyelid–gaze dyskinesis (lid retraction on downgaze/adduction = pseudo-Graefe); pupil–gaze dyskinesis (pupil constricts on downgaze/adduction).
Treatment: Prism/patching; strabismus surgery if no improvement after 6 months.
Follow-Up: Based on underlying condition; RTC immediately for any changes.

Binocular Vision – Mega Clinical Pearls
35 of 34
• Vergence Criteria: Sheard’s Criterion works best for exophoria (compensating vergence ≥ 2× phoria); Percival’s Criterion works best for esophoria (middle 1/3 of total vergence range must include 0).
• NPC: A reduced NPC is a hallmark of convergence insufficiency.
• AC/A Clues: High AC/A → convergence excess or divergence excess; low AC/A → convergence insufficiency or divergence insufficiency.
• Distance vs Near Patterns:
  – Distance eso > near → divergence insufficiency
  – Distance exo > near → divergence excess
  – Near eso > distance → convergence excess
  – Near exo > distance → convergence insufficiency
• MEM Patterns: High lag → accommodative insufficiency or esophoria; lead → accommodative excess/spasm or convergence insufficiency.
• Lens Clues: Difficulty with plus → accommodative excess or esophoria; difficulty with minus → accommodative insufficiency or convergence excess.
• CN Palsy Red Flags: CN III palsy with pupil involvement = aneurysm until proven otherwise; aberrant regeneration NEVER follows ischemic CN III palsy.
• INO Localization: Eye that fails to adduct = side of the lesion (MLF).
• Nystagmus Localizers:
  – Convergence-retraction → pineal/dorsal midbrain
  – Downbeat → Chiari malformation
  – See-saw → chiasmal/parsellar lesion
• Myasthenia Gravis: No pupil involvement; variability and fatigability are key; ice pack test supports diagnosis; dysphagia or dyspnea = emergency.
