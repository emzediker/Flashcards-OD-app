Anterior cornea = brightest, small, virtual, upright; Posterior cornea = bright, very small, virtual, upright; Anterior lens = faint, largest, virtual, upright; Posterior lens = faintest, smallest, real, inverted.

Neutral Density (ND) Filters
2 of 14
Equally transmit all wavelengths of light; used to quantify an APD by placing ND filter over the good eye until RAPD neutralizes.

Pulfrich Phenomenon
3 of 14
ND filter over one eye causes delayed neural signal producing apparent elliptical motion of a pendulum; right eye ND → counterclockwise ellipse, left eye ND → clockwise; can occur naturally with cataract or media opacity.

Optical Filter Types
4 of 14
Broad-band = transmits large wavelength range; Narrow-band = transmits small wavelength range; Long-pass = transmits only long wavelengths; Interference filters transmit a single wavelength via destructive interference.

Köllner’s Rule
5 of 14
Optic nerve pathology typically causes red-green defects, retinal pathology causes blue-yellow defects; exception is glaucoma, which is optic nerve disease with early blue-yellow loss.

Troxler Effect
6 of 14
Stationary peripheral objects fade from perception due to neural adaptation; micro-saccades normally prevent this fading.

Broca–Sulzer Effect
7 of 14
Brief flashes of light lasting approximately 50–100 ms appear brighter than shorter, longer, or continuous stimuli.

Brücke–Bartley Effect
8 of 14
Flickering light appears brighter than steady illumination of the same physical intensity.

Stiles–Crawford Effect
9 of 14
Light entering the eye perpendicular to photoreceptors is perceived as brighter due to optimized cone waveguiding.

Maxwell Spot
10 of 14
Central red spot perceived when viewing mixed blue and red light due to macular pigment selectively absorbing blue wavelengths.

Moore’s Lightning Streaks
11 of 14
Flashes of light associated with posterior vitreous detachment or retinal detachment caused by vitreoretinal traction.

Contrast Sensitivity
12 of 14
Measured in log units; normal adult threshold approximately 1.65, decreases with age; optic neuritis commonly causes reduced contrast sensitivity.

Spatial Frequency Conversion
13 of 14
Divide cycles per degree by 30 to estimate the Snellen denominator.

Color Vision Disorders & Testing
14 of 14
Approximately 8% of males affected (deutan most common); Achromatopsia = absent cone function, poor visual acuity, severe photophobia, pendular nystagmus, normal rod ERG with absent cone response; Nagel anomaloscope is the only test that differentiates anomalous trichromats from dichromats; mixture field norms: Normal = 45/17, Protanope = 73/0 or 0/87, Deuteranope = 0–73/17, Protanomalous = >45/10, Deuteranomalous = <45/17.
