Definition: Reflections formed by ocular surfaces.
Anterior Cornea: Brightest; small; virtual; upright.
Posterior Cornea: Bright; very small; virtual; upright.
Anterior Lens: Faint; largest; virtual; upright.
Posterior Lens: Faintest; smallest; real; inverted.

Neutral Density (ND) Filters
2 of 14
Property: Equally transmit all wavelengths of light.
Clinical Use: Quantify an afferent pupillary defect (APD).
Method: Place ND filter over the good eye until RAPD neutralizes.

Pulfrich Phenomenon
3 of 14
Mechanism: ND filter over one eye delays neural transmission.
Effect: Pendulum appears to move in an elliptical path.
Direction: Right eye ND → counterclockwise ellipse; left eye ND → clockwise.
Clinical Relevance: Can occur naturally with cataract or other media opacity.

Optical Filter Types
4 of 14
Broad-Band: Transmits a large range of wavelengths.
Narrow-Band: Transmits a small range of wavelengths.
Long-Pass: Transmits only long wavelengths.
Interference Filters: Transmit a single wavelength via destructive interference.

Köllner’s Rule
5 of 14
Optic Nerve Disease: Red–green color defects.
Retinal Disease: Blue–yellow color defects.
Exception: Glaucoma — optic nerve disease with early blue–yellow loss.

Troxler Effect
6 of 14
Phenomenon: Stationary peripheral objects fade from perception.
Cause: Neural adaptation.
Prevention: Micro-saccades normally prevent fading.

Broca–Sulzer Effect
7 of 14
Finding: Brief flashes appear brighter than continuous light.
Timing: Peak brightness at approximately 50–100 milliseconds.

Brücke–Bartley Effect
8 of 14
Finding: Flickering light appears brighter than steady illumination of equal physical intensity.

Stiles–Crawford Effect
9 of 14
Principle: Light entering perpendicular to photoreceptors is perceived as brighter.
Mechanism: Optimized cone waveguiding.

Maxwell Spot
10 of 14
Appearance: Central red spot.
Mechanism: Macular pigment selectively absorbs blue wavelengths when viewing mixed red and blue light.

Moore’s Lightning Streaks
11 of 14
Description: Brief flashes of light.
Cause: Vitreoretinal traction.
Associations: Posterior vitreous detachment or retinal detachment.

Contrast Sensitivity
12 of 14
Measurement: Log units.
Normal Adult Threshold: ~1.65.
Trends: Decreases with age.
Clinical Association: Reduced in optic neuritis.

Spatial Frequency Conversion
13 of 14
Rule: Divide cycles per degree by 30.
Purpose: Estimate the Snellen denominator.

Color Vision Disorders & Testing
14 of 14
Epidemiology: ~8% of males affected; deutan defects most common.
Achromatopsia: Absent cone function; poor visual acuity; severe photophobia; pendular nystagmus; normal rod ERG with absent cone response.
Key Test: Nagel anomaloscope — only test that differentiates anomalous trichromats from dichromats.
Mixture Field Norms:
• Normal: 45/17
• Protanope: 73/0 or 0/87
• Deuteranope: 0–73/17
• Protanomalous: >45/10
• Deuteranomalous: <45/17
